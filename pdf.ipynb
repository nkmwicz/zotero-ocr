Introduction A Wealth ofTerritory: Mapping the Early Modern World In 1525 Catherine ofAustria married Joao III ofPortugal in a union aimedat cementing an alliance between two of the most powerful royal houses insixteenth - century Europe. The first was the House ofHabsburg presidedover by Catherine's brother, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, and thesecond the Portuguese House of Avis, ruled by Joao III, self - styled'Lordof Guinea and of the Conquest, Navigation and Commerce of Ethiopia, Arabia, Persia and India'. I To commemorate the union Joao commissioneda series of lavish tapestries entitled The Spheres from the renowned tapestry workshops ofBrussels. They were a particularly appropriate symbol ofthe union between Joao and his prospective wife, who arrived in Lisbonarmed with an impressive array ofher own collection ofFlemish tapestriesas well as illuminated manuscripts, assorted family jewellery, furniture andan extensive wardrobe, objects of aesthetic magnificence designed to emphasize her political importance. 2 Attributed to the designs ofthe Flemishpainter Bernard van Grley, the Spheres series culminated in a final tapestrydepicting a terrestrial globe which, flanked by the Portuguese king and hisnew wife Catherine, vividly portrayed the territories to the south and eastof Portugal to which its sovereign Joao claimed entitlement (illus. I). This remarkable tapestry portrays the two newly married sovereigns as Jupiter and Juno, majestically presiding over the terrestrial and celestialworlds which they survey. The symmetry of the composition, which suspends the terrestrial globe between the sun above and the moon below, enhances the centrality and authority of Joao and Catherine as rulers ofnot only the terrestrial sphere but also a celestial sphere from which emanates an image of symmetrical perfection and, by implication, globalharmony. However, it is the terrestrial sphere which occupies the symboliccentre ofthe composition (illus. 2), and it is upon this thatJoao regally restshis royal sceptre, and to this that Catherine gestures with her right hand. Whilst the celestial iconography of the tapestry seeks to confer legitimacyand authority upon the imperial line personified by the union between Joao and Catherine, it is the terrestrial globe which becomes the primaryfocus for the ratification of this legitimacy and authority. Joao's sceptrerests upon the city of Lisbon, the home of the Portuguese House of Avis, since the early fifteenth century the point ofdeparture for Portuguese seaborne voyages down the west coast of Africa and, from the tum of thesixteenth century, the starting point for maritime initiatives deep into the Indian Ocean. With incredible geographical accuracy the globe triumphantly records in both its nomenclature and its flags flying the arms of Portugal those territories claimed by the Portuguese maritime empire bythe time ofJoao's ascent to the Portuguese crown in 1521. Moving southand eastwards from the king's sceptre, the globe portrays West Africa, the Cape of Good Hope, East Africa, the entrance to the Red Sea, the mouthof the Persian Gulf, Calicut in southern India and, at the furthest reachesof contemporary geographical knowledge, on its easternmost extremity, Malacca and the spice - producing islands of the Moluccas, all territoriesputatively under the sway of Joao and his new queen Catherine. In onebreathtaking visual conceit the globe visualizes Joao's claim to geographically distant territories, whilst also imbuing his claims with a moreintangible access to esoteric cosmological power and authority reflectedin the celestial iconography which surrounds the central terrestrial globe. It is the geographical scope ofthe Spheres tapestry and the ways in whichit envisages claims to political power and authority over distant territorieswhich forms the basis of this study of the ways in which princes, geographers, diplomats, sailors and merchants mapped the diverse spaces of theearly modern world. The sweep ofterritory and ocean stretching eastwardsthrough Africa, the Indian Ocean and Southeast Asia, curving back towards Europe through the Red Sea and into the Mediterranean worldand Central Asia, is the focus of this analysis, not only in terms of howsuch geopolitical spaces came to be mapped by the geographers of theearly modern world, but also in terms of the ways in which the encountersand exchanges carried out across these territories came to define the spaceof Europe itself as a social and cultural entity. The most resonant visualand material object which traces this geographical and social process isthe map itself, the global geographical representation of the shape of theworld as it appeared to sovereigns likeJoao III and Charles V, the changingshape of which is traced in this study. The history ofthis mapping ofthe early modern world inevitably invokesscientific narratives ofthe development ofthe discipline ofgeography as anincreasingly objective and definitive account of the relations of points andfeatures on the earth's surface to each other. Historians ofboth science andcartography have provided illuminating accounts of the part played byfifteenth - and sixteenth - century geography in shaping subsequent scientific traditions which pursued the ideals of objective, verifiable and disinterested enquiry.3 However, these accounts have invariably imposed aretrospective logic upon the development ofcartography and geographicalknowledge, which establishes a teleology of progress upon such materialwhere little exists. They have also tended to reify world maps and globes asprotoscientific objects divested of any wider social significance, and havelimited the ways in which these objects came to be utilized both practicallyand imaginatively within a range of social situations. It is this utilization ofmaps and globes which I am concerned with throughout this book. To take the reproduction of the terrestrial globe within the Spheres. Thetapestry is itself an apparently unfamiliar context within which torepresent such a highly specific image. However, in many ways the reproduction of the globe within it is highly appropriate in terms of the culturalstatus accorded to maps and globes more generally as valuable materialobjects which were enhanced by their ability to function at different levelsofsocial life. Like the tapestry itself, they were often utilized by sovereignssuch as Joao III for their ability to ratify their owners'claims to imperialauthority, to symbolize, or more often than not speculate on, the size, extent and potential enlargement of specific territorial domains. However, such world maps were not simply tools of imperial administration. Likethe Spheres tapestry, which mediated a diplomatic rapprochement betweenthe royal households of Habsburg and Avis, they also operated within anelaborate diplomatic economy of gift exchange. To proffer the gift of geographically precise and aesthetically magnificent maps of the worldestablished not only the indebtedness of the receiver, but also emphasizedthe power and authority of the giver, who could subsequently be seen tocommand an unprecedented level of political authority, purchasingpower and access to the arcane skills involved in map production. As withthe terrestrial globe at the centre of the Spheres tapestry, such maps invariably privileged the territories to which their eventual owner laid claim. They expressed the wonder and excitement of such exotic, commerciallytantalizing distant territories whilst also offering a reassuringly sanitizedvision of long - distance travel, whose deleterious effects were quietlyoccluded within lavishly illustrated maps of the known world. The social value accorded to world maps and globes throughout the latefifteenth and sixteenth centuries was therefore not predicated on theirscientific accuracy alone. Whilst they were valorized for their demonstration of learning, they were also valued for their ability to operate within awhole range of intellectual, political and economic situations, and to giveshape and meaning to such situations. In his highly influential treatise Deprincipis astronomiae et cosmographiae published in 1530 (illus. 10), the Habsburg - sponsored geographer Gemma Frisius was in no doubt as towho benefited from the increasingly fashionable globes of the type reproduced in the Spheres tapestry, arguing that: lI, GEMMA PHRY~ SIVS DE PRINCIPIIS A.STRONQ. mlz&Cofmogr3l'hl:r, Dc\"vfuGloblabcodem <dill.

For, certainly, this is the only one of all instruments whosefrequent usage delights astronomers, leads geographers, confirms historians, enriches and improves legists [les legistes], is admired by grammarians, guidespilots, in short, aside from its beauty, its form is indescribably useful and necessary for everyone.4 By 1570 the Elizabethan geographer and man of letters John Dee, in hishighly influential Preftce to Euclid's 'Elements o/Geometrie', was expanding Frisius'claims, locating maps as well as globes within the domestic interiors of Elizabethan England, and noting that: While, some, to beautifie their Halls, Parlers, Chambers, Galeries, Studies, or Libraries with; other some, for things past, as battles fought, earthquakes, heavenly firings, and such occurrences in histories mentioned: thereby lively as itwere to view the place, the region adjoining, the distance from us, and othersuch circumstances: some other, presently to vewe the large dominion of the Turke: the wide Empire of the Moschovite... Some, either for their ownejorneyes directing into farre landes: or to understand of other mens travailes. To conclude, some, for one purpose: and some, for an other, liketh, loveth, getteth, and useth, Mappes, Chartes, and Geographicall Globes. s What both Frisius and Dee emphasize in these accounts is the importanceof the geographical object in facilitating and envisaging the possibility forsocial and political change across a wide variety of spheres, including juridical, diplomatic, imperial, historical and commercial contexts withinwhich maps and globes increasingly came to playa part. Geographical artefacts were therefore not simply passive reflections ofthe expanding socialand imaginative horizons of so - called'Renaissance Man'.6 They were infact, as Frisius suggests, dynamic depictions of the changing geographicalshape of the early modem world, which were also inextricably bound upwith its changing diplomatic and commercial contours. It was throughboth the image of the map and the globe and their existence as valued material objects that the astronomers, historians, lawyers, grammarians, travellers, diplomats and merchants invoked by Frisius made sense of theshifting shape of their world. Geographical images such as the one portrayed on the Spheres tapestry mediated a whole range of social issues, from imperial conflict to commercial expansion. Why is it that it is theimage of the globe, rather than a madonna or even an emperor, which becomes central to an understanding of the meaning behind the wholecomposition of the Spheres tapestry? Throughout this book I want to emphasize that it is precisely upon the figure of the globe, as both a visualimage and a material object, that many of the social and cultural hopesand anxieties of the period came to be focused. For if the development ofthe terrestrial globe was coterminous with the geographical expansion ofthe horizons of the early modem world, then the intellectual and materialtransactions which went into its production were also symptomatic of theexpanding intellectual, political and commercial horizons of this world. Both the Spheres tapestry and the globe it depicts were imbued withstrikingly new artistic and social values in direct relation to the changingsocial dynamics of the world which they inhabited. The continually expanding horizons of overseas travel and territorial discovery hadramifications beyond the field of geography. The encounters with thoseterritories depicted in the globe within the Spheres produced a whole newrange of social and political possibilities, as well as problems. How weresuch encounters to be incorporated into contemporary systems of knowledge? To what extent did they question the veracity of such knowledge? What were the mechanisms by which sovereigns legitimately laid claimto such territories? How were the immense and complex commercialramifications of such encounters to be marshalled for maximum financialbenefit, and what impact would the experience of these commercial exchanges have on early modern society? These were the sort of questionswhich the political elites of the period began to ask, and it was in theshape of material objects such as maps and globes that they looked foranswers. These artefacts were perceived and circulated as valuable materialobjects through which the social practices and political contours of theearly modern world were given increasing definition, practically, commercially and intellectually. So, as can be seen in the Spheres, it is whollyappropriate to read the global image as representative of a ratification ofthe territorial, diplomatic and by implication imperial claims ofJoao III. In this sense the subject of the depiction of the terrestrial sphere withinthe tapestry is, iconographically, readily readable. However, the invocationof this sphere and the territories it portrays is at an even deeper levelmaterial, the material embodiment of the transactions that were carriedout across such territories, transactions which provided the very possibility for the production of this tapestry and the terrestrial globe upon it. The very substance of the materials and knowledges that went intomaking up the globe stemmed from the territories depicted upon theglobe itself and the complex commercial negotiations which went onwithin them. The silk which made up the bulk of the tapestry arrived inthe Brussels tapestry workshops by overland trade routes which stretchedthrough Central Asia and back into China, routes which were being increasingly supplemented by the influx of silk into northern Europeanports as a result of the establishment of the Portuguese seaborne route tothe east, vividly depicted across the tapestry's globe? The silver and goldwhich gave the tapestry its glittering aura still reached northern Europeprimarily via West Africa, Mozambique and Southeast Asia, all territoriesprominently marked across the globe as being under Portuguese jurisdiction. The brilliant colours which gave the tapestry its compositionaldefinition also emanated from Portuguese transactions throughout Southeast Asia which brought back natural products such as vermilion, indigo, myrobalans, lac, saffron and alum,8 which revolutionized European dyeingtechniques, and hence the threads used in tapestries such as the Spheres. The globe situated at the centre of the Spheres can therefore be read as anobject within which such transactions became both subject and substance, a material and visual cipher which appeared to make all these transactionspossible. What is even more remarkable about the representation of the globe inthe Spheres tapestry is that it painstakingly reproduced the eastern coordinates ofcontemporary maps ofthe Portuguese discoveries in the east, suchas the so - called'Cantino Planisphere', believed to have been produced in 1502 (illus. 4). Like the globe depicted on the Spheres, this Planisphere rendered in minute detail the territories encountered by the Portuguesethroughout Africa and Asia, and included the coastline of Brazil, discovered by the Portuguese commander Pedro Alvares Cabral in 1500, justprior to the map's completion. Its elaborate finish and highly decorativeappearance suggest that it was in fact a copy of the so - called'Padron Real'held in the Armazem da Guine eIndias (the official repository in the Guineaand India Office) in Lisbon, on which new discoveries were recorded assoon as information was collated in the light of returning expeditions.9 In November 1502 Alberto Cantino, an agent acting on behalf of Ercoled'Este, the Duke of Ferrara, paid an anonymous Portuguese cartographertwelve gold ducats for the map, which was subsequently smuggled out of Lisbon and installed in Ercole's library in Ferrara. The story of the Cantino Planisphere is symptomatic of the diverse circulation of maps and, from the first decades of the sixteenth century, globes, throughout the early modern world. Ercole d'Este clearly valuedit as perhaps the most comprehensive and up - to - date visualization of the Portuguese seaborne discoveries. However, the possession of an objectwhich more than any other cultural artefact represented geographicallyand culturally distant phenomena also appeared to gave Ercole access to adeeper, more intangible level of learning and authority inscribed in the Planisphere's mastery of the terrestrial world. As with the depiction ofthe celestial world contained within the Spheres tapestry, comprehensiveknowledge of the terrestrial sphere inferred a level of mystical power andauthority which legitimated claims to mastery of more esoteric and celestialrealms. Possession of decoratively elaborate and aestheticallymagnificent maps such as the Cantino Planisphere empowered theirowners in making a series of claims to both worldly and other - worldlyauthority. In the introduction to his version ofPtolemy's Geographia, published in Florence in 1482, the Florentine geographer Francesco Berlinghieri (of whom more later) argued that the discipline of geographyand its visual manifestation, the world map:... offers divine intellect to human genius, as if it were by nature celestial, demonstrating how with true discipline, we can leap up within ourselves, withoutthe aid ofwings, so that we may view earth through an image marked on a parchment. Its truth and greatness declared, we may circle all or part of it, pilgrimsthrough the colour of a flat parchment, around which the heavens and the starsrevolve. 10 Berlinghieri's evocative formulation is remarkably similar to the relationship between celestial and terrestrial spheres which we see in the Spherestapestry, and is symptomatic of the ways in which geographical information, encapsulated in the'flat parchment'of maps like the Cantino Planisphere, came to be valued for esoteric, as well as more strictly pragmatic, reasons. Invariably it was the more pragmatic considerations of trade and diplomacy which provided the immediate impetus for the production of mapssuch as the Cantino Planisphere. The rhetoric of mysterious power andauthority which possession of the map enabled its owner to produce (exemplified in Berlinghieri's poetic account ofthe importance ofgeography), ultimately found its equivalence in the political and commercial dynamicswhich fuelled the production of such maps. An artistically cultivated butalso politically astute figure like Ercole d'Este was as keen to possess a mapsuch as the Cantino Planisphere for what it could tell him about the extentof Portuguese interpolation into the spice trade of Southeast Asia, as hewas eager to possess the more esoteric powers which its mysterious auraconferred upon him. The map itself is studded with references to the markets and commodities ofBrazil, West Africa, the Red Sea and India. Abovethe Portuguese trading stations established in Guinea on the west coast of Africa, the Planisphere notes that from here:... they bring to the most excellent prince Dom Manuel king ofPortugal in eachyear twelve caravels with gold; each caravel brings twenty - five thousand weightsofgold, each weight being worth five hundred reais, and they further bring manyslaves and pepper and other things of much profit. I I Near Sumatra a legend reads: This island called the Toporbana is the greatest island found in the whole worldand richest in everything, to wit, gold and silver and precious stones and pearlsand very big and fine rubies and all kinds of spices and silks and brocades, andthe people are idolators and well disposed and trade with foreigners and muchmerchandise is taken from here abroad and other merchandise which is not inthis island is brought in. 12 Such maps were therefore keys not only to arcane information and esotericlearning, but also to trade routes, market - places and commodities valuedby the merchants and financiers of early modern Europe. The aura theyexuded was undoubtedly mysterious and other - worldly for many of thepeople who possessed them; but this aura was also pervaded by a muchmore acquisitive and commercial ethos with which the development ofmaps and globes of the period was inextricably entwined. The first known terrestrial globe was made by the Nuremberg merchant Martin Behaim, who produced his so - called'erdglobus'in 1492 as a resultof his sustained commercial activities along the coast ofWest Africa whilstbased in Lisbon throughout the 1480s (illus. 3). Like the Cantino Planisphere, which appears to be indebted to Behaim for much of itsinformation on geography and trade, Behaim's globe was covered with aprofusion ofcommercial notes on market - places, goods worth purchasing, local trading practices and the movement ofcommodities which give littledoubt as to the audience to which it was addressed. As such maps andglobes increasingly became part of the expanding commercial world ofthe period, they themselves became exchangeable objects caught up innew and highly elaborate forms of commercial transaction. From the endof the fourteenth century maps and sea charts were being exchanged bymerchant - cartographers for consignments of pepper,13 and by the beginning ofthe sixteenth century possession ofa map was often metaphoricallyand financially compared to the purchasing of the spices, pepper, silk andprecious metals to which it appeared to give directional access. In 1592 the English took a Portuguese carrack off the Azores laden with goods from asfar afield as China; the English geographer Richard Hakluyt recorded withwonder that the cargo included'spices, drugges, silkes, calicos, quilts, carpets', not to mention pearls, musk, civet, porcelain, furs and bedsteads. Butabove all, Hakluyt recorded with delight the discovery amongst the cargoof a map of the Portuguese trading regions:... inclosed in a case of sweete Cedar wood, and lapped up almost an hundredfold in fine calicut - cloth, as though it had beene some incomparable jewell. I4 For Hakluyt, the discovery of the precious map and the navigational (andhence commercial) possibilities which it promised inspired even morewonder and excitement than the exotic and precious commodities captured on board the carrack. The map was even more prized for itspromise of offering the English themselves access to territories whichwould yield such fabulous commodities. The value of maps and geographical information such as that described by Hakluyt therefore took onthe more strictly commercial ethos of such goods, as the market - place ofsixteenth - century Europe grew in size and complexity. Maps and globesvisualized the changing world to people like the English who had been relatively peripheral to the great discoveries of the preceding decades, achanging world which, as Hakluyt suggests, was driven by commercial imperatives. The maps, sea charts and globes of the period performed a dual function. Not only were they displayed as confident imperial symbols of thepower and authority of sovereigns like Joao III and Charles V when layingclaim to territories, or even trading in those to which they claimed possession. They were also highly complex objects which were symptomatic ofthe more pragmatic diplomatic and commercial exchanges between empires. These empires were characterized by their opportunistic existenceas trading territories eager to expand the range of their commercial influence within geographically distant places. However, these were far - flungterritories over which the empires had little ability to seriously establishanything like the regimes of colonial power and authority which were tocharacterize the developments of the proceeding European empires ofthe eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It becomes clear that the valueof the decorative world map and its spherical corollary, the terrestrialglobe, developed, as Frisius noted, primarily through the sheer diversityof situations within which they came to give meaning to the social lives ofthose people who increasingly used them within the worlds of trade, commerce, art, diplomacy and imperial administration. New Worlds, Old Worlds Hakluyt's purloined Portuguese map, the similarly appropriated Cantino Planisphere, and the globe represented on the Spheres tapestry all exhibitnot only the diverse range of situations within which the geographicalimage as material object comes to achieve its social value. They also havein common a geographical focus on the territories to the east of what wewould today call western Europe, the so - called'Old World'of central Europe, Africa and Asia prior to the'discovery'of the so - called'New World'by Christopher Columbus in 1492. This study deliberately focuseson the redefinition of this Old World rather than the impact of the New World. It does so for two specific reasons. Firstly, the impact of the discoveries in the New World on the imagination of early modern Europe was amuch slower process than has often been believed. News of these voyageswas invariably partial and contradictory, and the territories discoveredwere for many years perceived as simply extensions of those of Southeast Asia by commentators reluctant to believe in the existence of a distinctfourth continent (Columbus never subscribed to the belief that he had infact discovered a separate continent). For many early modern sailors, geographers, diplomats, merchants and monarchs the central politicalpreoccupations of the period remained resolutely fixed on the conflictover possession of territories, monopolization of trade routes and establishment of commercial centres throughout the coastal territories of theeastern Mediterranean, West and East Africa, Southeast Asia and the eastern Indian Ocean. Secondly, the narrative of the discovery of the New World resonated within the western imagination in a manner disproportionate to its apparent impact on the culture of early modern Europe. The stories of cultural encounters with the east lack the immediacy andvividness of the originary dramas of discovery offered in the accounts ofthe New World, partly because these encounters had been ongoing forcenturies before the discovery of America. Anglo - American scholars ofthe early modern period have also, to differing degrees, embraced a discourse of Orientalism which has created and naturalized the assumptionof an East, or so - called'Orient', as a mysterious, exotic, dangerous and ultimately atavistic place. One of the consequences of this criticalmarginalization has been the elision of the impact of so - called'eastern'elements on the Renaissance, one of the most crucial and arguably definitive periods of western European civilization. Traditionally the Renaissance, with all its politically loaded connotations of the'rebirth'of a selectively Aryan set ofGraeco - Roman values, transmitted via a reified classicalworld, has been expunged of any potentially disruptive'oriental'components or influences. 15 As a result, the encounters with the east recorded across the surface ofthe Spheres tapestry have subsequently been downplayed in histories of'The Renaissance', not only because of the complexity of negotiating cultural difference with peoples, ideas and objects which have retrospectivelybeen simply defined as'oriental', but also because it is not possible toemplot the narratives of encounter, conquest and domination, whichhave characterized the Renaissance story of the Americas, across the territories depicted on Joao's tapestry. The encounters recorded by the Portuguese, and subsequently the English and the Dutch, as they saileddown the African coast and onwards into the Indian Ocean, stretch fromthe fifteenth century to well into the early seventeenth, and indicate a levelof negotiation and transaction in a variety of social, cultural, commercialand political exchanges which cannot be adequately explained within thelogic ofa much later model of the development of the discourse of colonialism. As the locations marked across the globe of the Spheres tapestryindicate, the footholds of early European maritime advances throughoutthe Old World were highly tenuous coastal locations, ports and key townswhich invariably defined rapidly chosen points ofcommercial contact andexchange. Whilst these forms of transaction and exchange preceded later European practices of plantation and colonization, their ethos was significantly different. What needs to be stressed here is not that these earlymodern transactions did not lay the foundations upon which later practices of colonization developed, but rather thatthe territories wereperceived by the Portuguese and their immediate successors as possessingcultural and commercial agency which has been denied them by subsequent colonial accounts of their historical status. It is in direct oppositionto this perception of a sweeping overview of the wider development of European colonial history that this study defines itself. Furthermore, the intrepid figure of Renaissance Man does not seem tohave ventured across such enormous distances primarily in curious pursuit of new horizons of learning and understanding, armed with aninnately superior sense of his identity and'civilizing'mission. On the contrary, he encountered distant territories as potentially lucrative markets fornew commodities which Europe sorely lacked, and for which both he andhis fellow voyagers could rapidly create an eager demand back home in themarts of northern Europe. Early voyagers soon became aware of the lim - itations of European commodities; when the Portuguese commander Vasco da Gama landed in Calicut in southern India in 1498, after the firstmomentous crossing of the Indian Ocean by a western European, his giftsto the Samorin of Calicut were considered so poor next to the spices, silksand precious metals which surrounded the ruler that local Muslim merchants advised him to refrain from offering the gifts, lest the samorinshould take offence. Nor was it surprising that the locals were unconvinced by the claims of the sick and bedraggled Portuguese to have comefrom a great empire across the sea. The Portuguese came from the sea andapparently lived in ships; in India, only those who were so poor that theycould not afford their own patch of land would think of going to sea andliving on ships.17 What is so fascinating about the maps and globes whichwere directly created from such encounters across the space of the Old World is the ways in which they mediated such experiences, in establishingthe transactional nature of such cultural encounters (transactions whichoften provided the very possibility for the production of many maps ofthe period). Ultimately they also offered a highly sanitized version of theexchanges between trading territories throughout the Old World. In seeking to address the critical, cultural and geographical occlusion ofwhat has come to be naturalized as'the East'within the coordinates of adeveloping global geography, it should be remembered that the geographical antecedents of the geographers of the early modern world lackedany perception of a directional'east', or even of the very distinction between the geographical and symbolic concepts of'west'and'east'. Thisbecomes clear in a brief consideration of the predominant geographicaltraditions which informed late medieval thought. In attempting to definethe shape and scope of geographers'perceptions prior to the voyages anddiscoveries ofthe late fifteenth century, it should be recalled that medievaland early modern geographical thinking was incredibly diverse and contradictory, and in no way cohered as a single body of knowledge. It is notwithin the scope of this study to provide a comprehensive overview ofthese varied conceptions of geography. However, I would like to examine, albeit briefly, two particularly visible strands of thought which became increasingly definable throughout the fifteenth century, in order to trace theways in which they conceptualized the geographical coordinates of theclassical and medieval worlds, and see how these coordinates were gradually redefined by the maps and globes of the sixteenth century. The first particularly dominant cartographic tradition which encapsulated the medieval world picture was the so - called'T - O'map (illus. II). Historians ofcartography have traced its emergence to the Ionian philosophers of the fifth century Be. However, its development as a cartographicimage throughout later centuries gradually took on a decidedly Christian I I Zaccaria Lilia, 'T - 0'world map, 1496, woodcut. British Library, London. emphasis. 18 Arranged with what might now be called'east'at the top, the T within the hemisphere as a whole (the so - called'0') split the earth into Asia (which occupied the entirety of the upper half of the image), Europe (positioned bottom left) and Africa (bottom right). Running from left toright the Tanais (Don) and Nile rivers form the crossbar of the T, whilstthe Mediterranean represents the downstroke. A geographical embodiment of the Christian cross itself, this highly schematic map placed Jerusalem at both its geographical and symbolic centre. However, thiswas a centre which clearly defined itselfprimarily in terms ofthe territorieswhich today would be defined as'eastern', but which were, within the orientation of the T - O map, apparently'northern'. It was these territories, usually marked on the map as'Asia', which encapsulated both the hopesand the deep - seated fears of Christian thought and belief. The locationof the terrestrial paradise was invariably at the top of such maps and thusat the limit of the known world, which was fixed at the furthest edges of Asia. However, the vast, distant spaces ofAsia also yielded their own peculiar terrors. The savage tribes ofGog and Magog, whose emergence on the Last Day would, it was believed, herald the end of the world, were locateddeep in the region. '9 Within such geographical conceptions, howeversymbolic they may have been, the space which later came to be defined as'the East'was clearly a highly significant, imaginatively powerful and symbolically charged place, which gave meaning to the terrestrial as well ascelestial world picture of medieval Christianity. The impact of printing throughout Europe towards the end of the fifteenth century made the simple design of the basic T - O outline aparticularly attractive image to reproduce in early books, particularly as itcircumvented many of the technical problems associated with unifYingimages and printed texts. However, the increasing visibility of the T - O image in late fifteenth - century texts failed to reflect the increasing diversification this basic image was undergoing, a diversification which began toemerge in the enormous circular mappae - mundi (world maps) of the latefourteenth and fifteenth centuries. These maps were not printed butwere lavishly decorated manuscripts, commissioned to adorn the walls ofcourts and churches. Whilst they retained the directional coordinates ofthe T - O map, they increasingly registered the proliferation of diplomatic, commercial and territorial information garnered from innumerable travellers who reported on the territories to the directional east of mainland Europe.2o Even as early as the late fourteenth century such mappae - mundiwere being produced and circulated as precious objects whose possessionwas perceived to be coterminous with the precious goods from Africa and Asia to which they seemed to offer access. Whilst still ostensibly adheringto the religious principles underpinning the symbolism of the basic T - O map, evidence which still exists recording the production and receptionof these mappae - mundi suggests that their central preoccupation was notjust with the territories positioned at the top of the map (Africa and Asia), but was also with the exotic, precious goods which came fromthem. The imposing mappa - mundi made for the Portuguese Affonso V in 1459 by the Italian cosmographer Fra Mauro (illus. 4) exemplifies theextent to which the basic outline of the T - O map came to accommodatethis proliferation of knowledge about the peoples, customs, goods andmarket - places in the territories throughout the upper half of the map.21 Whilst such information was often bizarre and fantastic, it was also at crucial points surprisingly accurate. As well as incorporating recent Portuguese and Italian travels and voyages along the west coast of Africaand into Central Asia, Fra Mauro's mappa - mundi also reproduced insome detail the traffic in spices and pepper throughout the Indian Ocean: Java minor, a very fertile island, in which there are eight kingdoms, is surrounded by eight islands in which grows the'sotil specie'. And in the said Javagrow ginger and other fine spices in great quantities, and all the crop from thisand the other [islands] is carried to Java major, where it is divided into threeparts, one for Zaiton [Chang - chow] and Cathay, the other by the sea of Indiafor Ormuz, Jidda and Mecca, and the third northwards by the Sea of Cathay. 22 With a diameter of nearly 2 metres, its parchment surface lavishly coveredin details picked out in lapis lazuli and gold leaf, the Fra Mauro mappamundi combined aesthetic magnificence with highly specific commercialinformation in a way which was designed not only to confirm the standingof Affonso's court in the Christian world picture, but also to celebrate thegrowing status of the Portuguese as powerful political and commercialsuch imposing mappae - mundibrokers as their voyages of discovery opened new markets down the westcoast of Africa. Mappae - mundi therefore operated as vast visual encyclopaedias,23 which offered their patrons a privileged and highly flatteringperception of their place in an expanding world, as well as reflecting theirparticularly acquisitive commercial and political agendas. In the summerof 1399 Baldassare degli Ubriachi, a wealthy Florentine merchant, commissioned fourfrom two eminentgeographers based in Barcelona: Jafuda Cresques and Francesco Becaria.24 Ubriachi dealt in a range of ivory, precious gems, pearls and jewels purchased through extensive trading connections which he had establishedthroughout the eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East. He intendedto take the maps with him on a business trip to sell his precious wares at thecourts of Aragon, Navarre, Ireland and England, and to present them tothe regents of the provinces in the hope of obtaining rights offree passageand trading privileges throughout their realms. No record exists as towhether or not Ubriachi delivered these expensive and carefully executedmaps. However, it seems clear from the records concerned with the commissioning ofsuch mappae - mundi that they served a dual function. As wellas being magnificent visual encyclopaedias designed to reflect the socialprestige of the select few (like Ubriachi) who were able to summon thewealth and intellectual awareness to commission such objects, the mapswere perceived by those who commissioned and possessed them to be coextensive with the precious, rare and unique jewels and gems alongsidewhich, in the case ofUbriachi, they travelled. Mappae - mundi were to be found throughout the churches and courts offifteenth - century Europe, vividly mediating the relationship between thecelestial and the terrestrial, reflecting not only the piety but also the wealthand worldliness of those who were able to commission such imposing artefacts. However, as the wealth of information which informed theproduction of mappae - mundi such as Fra Mauro's strained the confines ofthe standard T - O shape, the influence ofthis image came under increasingpressure with the growing authority in centres oflearning throughout Italyof the second predominant geographical tradition which emerged in latefourteenth and early fifteenth - century Europe: Claudius Ptolemy's classical text, the Geographia. Ptolemy produced his Geographia in Alexandria inthe second century AD. Enormous in its scope, it listed descriptions andlocations of, and distances between, over 8,000 places known to Ptolemyand his contemporaries, as well as offering an account of how to drawmaps of the regions described. Greek copies of the Geographia from thirteenth - century Byzantium transcribed its original descriptive chaptersand for the first time added maps of the territories described by Ptolemy. By the fourteenth century, Greek copies of Ptolemy's text were arriving in Italy primarily from Byzantium, along with the works of a whole host ofclassical Greek and Roman writers such as Plato, Aristotle and Cicero, which were copied and translated by humanist scholars eager to apply thephilosophical and scientific lessons of ancient thinking to the rapidlychanging world of early modern Europe.25 By the middle of the fifteenthcentury luxurious manuscript copies of the Geographia were being commissioned by powerful patrons keen to exhibit their taste and eruditionin investing in such a revered and increasingly influential classical text. Although the Geographia rejected the symbolic coordinates of the T - O map, it still focused on the supposed'eastern'territorial sweep ofthe schematic T - O image. The geographical scope of this world picture, known asthe oikoumene, stretched from India to the east and Gibraltar to the west, and from the steppes of Central Asia in the north to Ethiopia in the south (illus. 6). However, unlike the medieval mappae - mundi, what was significantly different about the emergence of Ptolemy's representation of theknown world was its conceptualization in terms of geometrical ratherthan symbolic principles. The world maps which were subsequentlydrawn up on the basis of his calculations on the size and shape of the oikoumene were therefore emplotted across a predetermined geometricalgrid of latitude and longitude whose guiding force was the principles ofabstract geometry rather than those of Christian symbolism, which haddefined the contours of the T - O map, and, to a lesser extent, medievalmappae - mundi. Within this spatially determined grid fifteenth - centurygeographers were able to plot a proliferation of locations across terrestrialspace which was no longer circumscribed by the principles of Christianbelief.26 Ptolemy's impact on the world of geography was to revolutionizea certain perception ofspace itself, which was no longer charged with religious significance but was instead a continuous, open terrestrial spaceacross which the monarchs and merchants who invested in copies of his Geographia could envisage themselves conquering and trading regardlessof religious prescription. The perception ofterrestrial space envisaged by Ptolemy's text certainlyrevolutionized early modern perceptions of geographical space, a legacywhich has influenced the discipline of geography to this day. However, the preoccupations which shaped the initial emergence and production ofthe Geographia suggest that it was primarily seized on as a text whichoffered its predominantly Italian audience an intense and visually arrestingengagement with the classical worlds of Greece and Rome. This commerce with the ancients took on both an intellectual and geographicalshape, as the scholars and their patrons fashioned the imaginative and topographical landscape of a classical world brought nearer, in both idealand territorial terms, in the maps produced on the basis of Ptolemy's cal - transactions which saw Ptolemy'sculations. Sequential regional maps of his oikoumene were carefully reproduced by fifteenth - century illuminators, whose beautifully executed mapsoffered their owners an insight into the geographical extension of theirown contemporary world, mediated through the enduring shape of the Graeco - Roman classical world picture. However, this classical world invoked by the intellectualtextincreasingly reproduced in fifteenth - century Italy was, in fact, far moreheterogeneous than many commentators have suggested. The frontispieceto the Greek scholar Cardinal Bessarion's magnificently illuminated Greekcopy of the Geographia, dated around 1453, is indicative of this intellectualheterogeneity (illus. 7). The illustration depicts Ptolemy himself, in themidst of a fabulous landscape of exotic and sumptuous architecture. Richly dressed in an ermine - lined cloak ofIslamic design, the ancient geographer holds an astrolabe, an instrument designed to measure thealtitude of the sun, moon and stars, and which no self - respecting scholarof geography or navigation would be without. To the right we see Ptolemy's study, represented as a typical fifteenth - century studioIi, crammedwith the paraphernalia of the fifteenth - century geographer. As well as another astrolabe hanging from the wall we can see a quadrant (also used formeasuring altitude) and two torqueta (elaborate instruments designed tomeasure the comparative coordinates of both celestial and terrestrialspheres). Richly bound manuscripts are artfully scattered throughout thestudioit'and, along with the array of scientific instruments, emphasize theesoteric erudition and arcane learning embodied in figures like Ptolemyand his fifteenth - century disciples. The power and authority accorded tosuch savants is here based on the tangible recovery of the knowledges ofthe classical world. However, the material substance of this process of intellectual recuperation envisaged in the illustration suggests a moreheterogeneous process of cultural transmission. The Islamic influence apparent in Ptolemy's cloak is also reflected in the range of cosmographicaland navigational instruments prominently displayed throughout the illustration. Both the astrolabe and torquetum were products of Arabicscientific research which emanated from centres of learning such as Cairoand Seville from the twelfth and thirteenth centuries,27 as did many of thegeometrical and astronomical manuscripts which had such a profound influence on geography and mapmaking in late fifteenth - century Europethe same sorts of manuscripts that we see scattered throughout Ptolemy'sstudioIi in Bessarion's copy of the Geographia. As Bessarion's Ptolemy emphasizes, the Geographia did not just define aterritorial orientation focused on the east and the geography of the classical world. Its transmission also exemplified the ways in which intellectualand material exchanges between the evolving space of early modern Europe and a classical world which included Arabic and Islamic influencesbecame vital to the intellectual definition of fifteenth - century Europe. Ascan be seen from the intellectual and material commerce enacted in Bessarion's copy of Ptolemy, and as with the representations of geographicalspace in both T - O and mappae - mundi traditions, the distinction between a Europeanized'west'and an Orientalized'east'is a retrospective dividewhich makes little sense when trying to trace the cultural exchangeswhich came to define the shape of the early modern world. The supposedly'western'world of Europe actually defined itself as coextensivewith, rather than in contradistinction to, the classical world of the east, whatever its intellectual and cultural dimensions. Intellectual recognitionand respect, political power and authority, commercial wealth and successall appeared to stem from contact with these'eastern'territories, whosemyriad riches appeared to be encapsulated in lavishly illustrated copies oftexts such as the Geographia. Ptolemy's maps defined the territorial landscape across which such transactions took place. However, this was alandscape which was not only confined to fifteenth - century Italy. As weshall see in more detail, the court of the Ottoman sultan Mehmed II possessed Latin copies of Ptolemy's Geographia, as well as activelyencouraging further research into the text in Arabic. This visible participation of the Ottoman court in the establishment of the Geographia as such afounding text ofearly modern geography is indicative ofthe ways in whichnot only the territories ofthe so - called east, but also its material wealth andits valuable knowledges were central to the definition of both the geographical and intellectual contours ofearly modern Europe. What might nowbe called'the East'was not a mysterious, distant space for the geographersof the period, but was in fact one from which they drew intellectual andmaterial sustenance. No text more vividly personified this process thanthe development of Ptolemy's Geographia, a text which retained themarks of its hybrid cultural emergence between Christian west and Islamiceast, rather than defining the social and cultural separation between thetwo cultures. It is clearly impossible to neatly separate out the visual and intellectualdevelopment of the T - O, mappae - mundi and Ptolemaic traditions withinthe complicated history of late medieval geography. However, it becomesclear that these diverse traditions defined certain geographical parameterswithin which the mapping of the known world began to achieve a consensual social definition. For all of these geographical traditions, the east wasnot a separate, mysterious space antithetical to the developing ideals of European civilization. On the contrary, this space which today would bereferred to as'the East'was filled with myriad territories from whichearly modern scholars imbibed spiritual, intellectual and material suste - nance. It is not within the bounds of this study to account for the ways inwhich this situation changed and redefined itself through the powerfullydivisive discourse of Orientalism, which has been so elegantly analysedby Edward Said.28 However, it could be argued that one particular technological development which hastened the subsequentintellectual andcultural polarization and bifurcation of East and West was the effect ofprinting on early European society. It is the impact of this new technologyon the field ofgeographical production which should now be considered inlooking at the ways in which print began to redefine the geographicalshape and social status of maps towards the end of the fifteenth century. Printing the World It was a sign of the influence and intellectual authority which manuscriptcopies of Ptolemy's text had upon the elite of fifteenth - century Europethat it was the Geographia which became one of the most prominent textsto be reproduced within the revolutionary new medium of print.29 In Bologna in 1477 an edition of Ptolemy's Geographia, complete with twentyseven maps, was engraved onto copper plates and printed for the veryfirst time (illus. 12). It was symptomatic of the importance and prestige accorded to the text that the Bologna edition of the Geographia was also one D What thisof the first printed books to contain engraved illustrations.3 emphasizes is the extent to which both the relatively new discipline ofmapmaking and the equally novel medium of print rapidly developed asoverlapping technologies throughout the latter half of the fifteenth century. Much has been said about the impact of the invention of printingon literacy and ways of reading, but less has been written about the equallymomentous impact of print upon the circulation and communication ofvisual information within areas such as science, engineering, botany and, ofcourse, geography.3 I Towards the end ofthe fifteenth century in Europeprint allowed for the development ofwhat William Ivins has called'the exactly repeatable pictorial statement'.32 Once the cartographic image wastransferred to a printing block or plate, it could be repeatedly reproduced, a standardized visual image free from the endless variations and idiosyncratic embellishments which a single illustration could experience at thehands of even the most gifted scribe or miniaturist. The consequences ofthis innovation, for both the status of maps and their subsequent perception amongst the elites of late fifteenth - century Europe, were profound. Printed editions of Ptolemy like the 1477 Bologna Geographia invariablyran to 500 copies which, although still incredibly expensive, began tocreate a book - buying community across the city - states of western Europewho became increasingly familiar with the Ptolemaic world picture as it 12 World map from Ptolemy, Geographia, Bologna, 1477. British Library, London. extended beyond the confines of its previously highly restricted circulationin manuscript form. The new technologies ofprint culture also allowed foran increasing diversity and complexity in the field of geographical representation. The advent of both the rolling press and line - engraving oncopper plates allowed for not only more uniform and efficient mass reproducibility of images, but also for finer detail in the delineation ofthe wealthof territories recorded in Ptolemy's work. The use of the technique ofcopper - engraving in the illustration of maps offered a sharper and moredetailed printed impression than the woodcut, and also allowed for detailto be added as new discoveries began to be made. Ptolemy's Geographia, with its wealth of place names and precise delineation of coastlines andislands, was not only a prestigious classical text deserving its transmissioninto the new medium of print. It was also a highly formal technical challenge to the printers and engravers of the new printing presses, who wereeager to exhibit their skills in integrating visual information and writtentext into one carefully crafted book. As a result, they began to establishnew vocabularies in their symbolic representation of both land and sea. The subsequent search for standardization in the visual language of cartography allowed for a level of geographical classification, definition andcomparison which had been hitherto impossible with the unique and unreproducible manuscript. Such classificatory possibilities were increased by the speed with whichthe medium of print came to dominate the field of geographical production towards the end of the fifteenth century. Within just ten years of itsinitial publication in 1477, no fewer than six new editions of Ptolemy's Geographia had been printed in Rome, Florence and VIm as well as Bologna, a testimony both to the popularity of the text and the success which thenew medium of print had achieved throughout southern and northern Europe. It has been estimated that of the 222 printed maps published upto the year 1500, at least half were directly based on Ptolemy's writings.33 The impact that this dissemination of his printed text had upon both itscommunity of readers and its status as a precious material object was significant. Whilst wealthy patrons of geography continued to covet lavishlyillustrated manuscript volumes of texts such as the Geographia, theybecame increasingly aware of the need to acquire printed editions as well. Possession of a unique manuscript copy of the Geographia signified thewealth and power of a patron's ability to commission such an expensiveobject. However, it rarely moved beyond the confines ofhis studioIi, a conspicuous symbol of consumption imprisoned within the confines of itsown precious uniqueness. The printed Ptolemy, however, shared a community of elite readers and commentators who built their discourses ofgeographical awareness around their ability to cross - reference geographical nomenclature which was being increasingly standardized within thelatest printed editions. Wealth and conspicuous consumption could bedisplayed in the possession of a manuscript copy of Ptolemy, but intellectual awareness and politic acumen were even more foregrounded in thestudy of a printed copy. Wealthy patrons and power brokers such as Federigo Montefeltro and the d'Este family were quick not only tocommission new manuscript texts but also to allow their names to be associated with new printing initiatives within the field. of academicgeography; many, like Mehmed II, ensured that they possessed bothmanuscript and printed copies of texts such as Ptolemy's Geographia intheir personal collections. The establishment of such a widening community of readers also affected the social and cultural status of maps and atlases like the Geographia. Whilst the printed copy gradually lost its status as a uniqueobject, its publishers and readers soon realized that such an infinitely reproducible, standardized text produced an imagined community whowere beginning to construct their geographical knowledge around theirunderstanding of such printed texts. As the dynamics of print culturebegan to dictate the intellectual development of geography throughoutthe sixteenth century, the printers, engravers and geographers of theperiod began to market their products as valuable commodities whichconnected a highly disparate collection of scholars, diplomats, merchantsand even monarchs scattered across the city - states of early modern Europe. The success of the great cartographers of the mid - sixteenth century, and in particular Abraham Ortelius and Gerardus Mercator, withwhom this study concludes, was based as much on their adroit manipulation of the medium of print as it was on their ability to fuse the classicalgeography of Ptolemy with the latest seaborne discoveries made throughout the period in Africa, Asia and the Americas. In the'Address'to hishighly influential Theatrum Orb s Terrarum published in Antwerp in 1570 (illus. 13), Ortelius deftly positioned his comprehensive printed atlas inrelation to manuscript and early printed maps: For there are many that are much delighted with Geography or Chorography, andespecially with Mappes or Tables contayning the plotts and descriptions of Countreys, such as there are many now adayes extant and every where to besold; But because that neither they have not that, that should buy them: or ifthey have so much as they are worth, yet they will not lay it out, they neglectthem, neither do they any way satisfie themselves. Others there are who whenthey have that which will buy them, would very willingly layout the money, were it not that by reasons of the narrownesse of the roomes and places, broadand large Mappes cannot so be opened or spread, that every thing in them mayeasily and well be seene and discern'd... This I having oft made triall of, I beganto bethinke my selfe, what meanes might be found to redresse these discommodities, which I have spoken of, and either to make them somewhat lesse, or, ifpossibly it might bee, to take them all cleane away. And at length me thought itmight be done by that meanes which we have observed and set downe in this ourbooke, to which I earnestly wish that every student would affoord a place in his Library, amongst the rest of his bookes.34 Ortelius had astutely comprehended the increasing limitations of manuscript maps and single - sheet printed maps which, by mid - century, hadbecome not only cumbersome to consult and display, but also gave thepurchaser scant return on his investment: such maps were, as a result ofthe specific conditions under which they had been produced, partial andlimited in the range of geographical knowledge which they offered. However, Ortelius'rapidly printed and distributed Theatrum could advertise itscomprehensive collection of knowledge, drawn from an extensive body ofgeographers and antiquarian scholars who were united in their relationship to the medium of print and broughttogether in one highlymarketable commodity: the atlas.35 For a price, as Ortelius tells us, thisatlas could take its place amongst the other valuable books required bythe sixteenth - century scholar or politician as he negotiated his waythrough an increasingly diverse world. Ortelius'fellow geographer and 13 Frontispiece to Abraham Ortelius, Thea/rum Orbis Terrarum, Antwerp, 1570. British Library, London. engraver Mercator wrote to him in November 1570 in the immediate aftermath of the publication of the Theatrum congratulating him on the successof this new printing venture, commenting that: You deserve no small praise, for you have selected the best descriptions of eachregion and have digested them in a single manual which without diminishing orimpairing the work of any, may be bought for a low price, kept in a small place, and even carried about wherever we wish... I am certain that this work ofyourswill always remain saleable, whatever maps may in the course of time be reprinted by others.36 Mercator immediately grasped the fact that with his Theatrum Orteliushad produced the ultimate geographical commodity. This was a comprehensive collection of maps and geographical descriptions collectedtogether in one portable book which was reproducible on a mass scale. This was an atlas which was an attractive material object which could beproudly displayed in a library, but which was also made even more valuableand coveted for the specific geographical knowledges it contained. It wasthese knowledges which, as will become clear, were to be of particularcommercial and political use to the diplomats and merchants who eagerlypurchased their copies of the Theatrum. Like its medieval manuscript pre - decessor the mappa - mundi, the Theatrum was a vast geographical encyclopaedia. But if the esoteric aura of mystery and secrecy associated with themappae - mundi appeared to be on the wane with the development ofprinted atlases such as the Theatrum, these atlases were to some extent reinvested with an aura of value equivalent to the access which they seemedto allow to a community of figures of power and influence who increasingly defined their geographical frame of reference through texts like the Theatrum. However, this rapid development of a highly sophisticated printed cartographic tradition did not automatically lead, as has often been assumed, to a complete dismissal ofearlier traditions, and in particular those exemplified by the Geographia. Both Mercator and Ortelius were instrumentalin reshaping the global picture created by Ptolemy into a more recognizably modern image. Gone were the most glaring omissions and erroneousassumptions in his descriptions. The territories of the Americas werepainstakingly added, the Mediterranean and the entirety of the landmassof Asia, which had both been greatly overestimated by Ptolemy, were reduced in breadth, and the Indian Ocean was no longer regarded aslandlocked. However, geographers such as Ortelius and Mercator remained fulsome in their praise and regard for Ptolemy. In the Preface tohis Theatrum Ortelius styled him'the Prince of Geographers', whilst Mercator's homage to the Alexandrian geographer was even more impressive. In 1578 he printed a beautifully engraved edition of the Geographia in aseries of plates, which remains one of the finest examples of sixteenthcentury map - engraving. These responses were undoubtedly carefullyexecuted strategies designed to ensure that the geographical output of thelikes of Ortelius and Mercator was perceived to complement rather thanreject the thinking of the revered Ptolemy. However, perhaps more significantly, these celebrations ofhis work reflected an identification ofthe earlyprinted development ofthe Geographia as a text which opened the possibiinnovation and the incorporation of newlity forgeographical information unknown in earlier manuscript maps. In thissense, atlases such as Ortelius'Theatrum were the logical outcome, ratherthan intellectual antithesis, ofearly printed texts of the Geographia. Theseearly editions of Ptolemy thrived on technical innovation in print cultureas well as gradually assimilating new geographical discoveries. Editionsbased on the Geographia, printed in 1482, incorporated contemporary information into their maps, and by the time of the publication of the Strasbourg edition in 1513 new sheets had been added to the atlas, as wellas detailed information on the shape and extent of the African coastlinegleaned from Portuguese reports.37 Rather than an ossified text weigheddown by outmoded geographical thinking, these early printed editionstechnologicalbecame technological and geographical palimpsests, shaped by the experimentations of early printers and geographers, who celebrated the text forits classical authority which allowed it to retain a certain intellectual cohesiveness. This allowed for the possibility of collating an enormous streamof new geographical information within one comprehensible framework, the skeleton structure of the Geographia. For this, later geographers suchas Ortelius and Mercator were grateful in their attempts to collate the diversity of geographical information into one saleable item: the printedatlas. However, just as this increasing authority of the printed atlas did notnecessarily dispel the authority of Ptolemy, nor did it signal the eclipse ofthe importance of the unique manuscript map, as has often been believed. Such maps remained significant as the raw material which the more sophisticated and technically polished printed maps produced by the earlyeditors of the Geographia and, much later, Ortelius and Mercator drewupon in complementing their classical geographical knowledges taken primarily from Ptolemy. Particularly important in this respect were the socalled'portolan charts', which were nautical aids used in the art of marinenavigation, depicting key ports and basic coastal features of specificstretches ofcoastline.38 They were used to assist in the smooth movementof seaborne trade throughout the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, thetwo areas from which they first emerged towards the end of the thirteenthcentury. It should be stressed that it was primarily these portolan charts, and not the printed atlases of Ptolemy, which gave merchants and sailorsconcrete practical information on how to navigate from one place to another. They emerged alongside their topographical counterparts, mapsand plans of developing urban centres, such as the anonymous'Plan of Acre'drawn around 1321 (illus. 14). It was these hydrographical and topographical manuscript maps, charts and plans which became the practicaltools used in solving highly particular and local problems such as disputations over land, military surveillance, movement ofcommercial goods andthe maintenance of efficient techniques of irrigation and water supply. Aswill become apparent in the following chapters, such manuscript maps remained of immense value in the explanation and solution of certainsensitive and politically contentious social situations throughout the sixteenth century. The sheer scale and size of the majority of printedcartography produced during this period ensured that collections ofmaps such as Ptolemy's Geographia and Ortelius'Theatrum were invariablyof little assistance in practical activities such as maritime navigation andland surveying. However, through their rapid incorporation of a range ofgeographical traditions (from hydrography to surveying), texts like the Theatrum established themselves as the most comprehensive, and hence 14 Anon, Plan of Acre, c. 1321, pen and wash on parchment, from Marino Sanuto, Libersecretorumjidelium crucis. Bodleian Library, Oxford. most desirable, collections of geographical information available. As aresult, their construction not only came to define the appearance and presentation of the discipline of geography towards the end of the sixteenthcentury, but it also shaped the social and geographical perceptions of thepolitical and intellectual elite of the period, perceptions which, as will beseen, were defined by the maps which they consulted. Conspicuous Cartographies Although the impact of the technology of print on the field of geographythroughout the sixteenth century was profound, print alone cannot beheld responsible for the enormous changes which took place in mapmaking and the discipline of geography as they moved into the seventeenthcentury. A central concern of this book is to stress the interplay betweennot only print culture and geographical representation, but also theextent to which these fields were themselves inextricably connected to theemergence of new forms of long - distance travel and radically differenteconomic systems of trade and exchange. It is, for instance, impossible todefine the extent to which initiatives within cartography and navigationdrove the discovery of new long - distance trade routes deep into areassuch as Southeast Asia, or vice versa. At certain points it is possible to seethe extent to which the discoveries within the fields ofprinted cartographyand navigational knowledge allowed for the swift dissemination of inforto the development of long - distance seaborne travel, mation crucialwhilst at others it is possible to see the ways in which the political andcommercial exigencies of such travel dictated the production of newforms ofgeographical knowledge. Whilst recent work on the history of cartography has stressed the centrality of mapping to the territorial claims ofwestern European colonialism, this has been, I would argue, at the expenseofan understanding of the ways in which commercial expansion primarilydictated the contours of cartographic production in the early modernperiod. Whilst claims to territorial possession were undoubtedly imbricated in the rhetoric of early European expansion, the rhetoric oftenmasked the realities of such expansion, which initially involved the highlylimited control of extensive sweeps of territory, in favour of establishingstrategic points of commercial significance across the map of the earlymodern world. It is therefore this connection between commercial development and cartographic production which concerns me in the chapterswhich follow. The aim of this book is not to produce a comprehensive overview of theincremental mapping of the early modern world, a subject which has beendealt with at great length elsewhere.39 It is, rather, concerned to investigatecertain key moments within this process of global mapping where the interpenetration of print, travel and commerce with mapmaking cometogether to define the dynamics of geographical representation withinthis period. An abiding fascination with maps, charts and globes comesfrom the extent to which such objects, as both texts and visual images, provide their owners with a promise of gain of some sort, be it financial, political or intellectual. The fascination with the geographical artefacts ofthe early modern period is the extent to which the language of possessionwhich characterizes ownership of the map is so often fused across all threefronts: financial gain, political gain and intellectual gain. In a period whereknowledge was invariably, and often highly effectively, conflated withwealth and political power, it is no wonder that the map became such anover - determined object to be possessed and coveted. One final examplewill suffice to underline this point, and to define the parameters withinwhich this book operates. In 1594 the Dutch cartographer Petrus Plancius published a map delocatedpicting the spice - producing islands known as the Moluccas, south - east of the Indonesian archipelago. Entitled Insulae Moluccae (illus. 15), it is a remarkably accurate hydrographic map, based on Mercator'smathematical projections and incorporating the printing techniques 15 Petrus Plancius, Insulae Moluccae, engraving, Antwerp, 1594. British Library, London. developed by Ortelius. Plancius was a respected and enthusiastic supporter of the Dutch joint - stock trading companies who were seeking to breakinto the lucrative spice market focused on the Moluccas, which had beenin the hands of the Portuguese since their arrival in the islands in thesecond decade of the sixteenth century.40 Across the bottom of the map Plancius depicted the tangible rewards to be very literally harvested if the Dutch could achieve their goal of full participation in the Moluccas spicetrade. Portrayed with botanical exactitude are nutmeg, cloves and threetypes of sandalwood, all highly lucrative commodities whose influx into Europe had been previously constrained by the increasingly inefficienttrading networks operated by the Portuguese. Plancius'engraved map ofthe islands had been sponsored by commercial interests with substantialfinancial stakes in ensuring successful Dutch involvement in the trade inspices. Whilst its commissioning and production follow similar patterns tothose developed in the production of mappae - mundi as well as Ptolemaicand Ortelius atlases, it defines a marked shift in these patterns. This valuable map, a commodified object utilized in the pursuit of financial gain, becomes coterminous with the commodities to which it promises access. Plancius'map is no longer a precious, unique jewellike Ubriachi's mappaemundi, designed to accompany an equally precious consignment of gems, ivory and jewels. Instead it takes its place in the world ofgoods to which itsnavigational armature can now allow access. Possession of the commodities on the map becomes, by the end of the sixteenth century, no longera dream but a tangible reality. Historically and representationally this book ends with Plancius'map. But what it seeks to trace throughout is the cartographic representationsof territory which this map shares with early Christian T - O maps, latemedieval mappae - mundi, Ptolemy's Geographia and Joao Ill's Spherestapestry. These are the territories through which the early modern worlddefined its intellectual and commercial development, the territories adjoining the coastline of Africa as it was traversed by seaborne voyagesthroughout the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, and the subsequent encounters, by way of the sea, with the Old World of classicalthought: the Middle East, Southeast Asia and myriad islands of the Indian Ocean. The following chapters analyse key moments in the historyofthis mapping ofthe early modern world, in an attempt to reconsider theimpact ofencounters with territories to the east ofmainland Europe whichhave been so central, not only to the development ofthe discipline of mapmaking but also to the idea of European culture itself. 2 An Empire Built on Water: The Cartographyof the Early Portuguese Discoveries The brief analysis offered in Chapter One of the Spheres tapestry whichadorned the court of Joao III graphically demonstrates the extent towhich the development of the early Portuguese seaborne empire and ofcartography as a form of geographical representation were inextricablyconnected. The profusion of charts, maps and globes which stemmedfrom the early Portuguese voyages of discovery vividly represented anddisseminated information on the scale and extent of Portugal's maritimeachievements. A brief comparison of the Spheres tapestry with the manuscript maps of Ptolemy's Geographia produced throughout Italy only fiftyyears earlier demonstrates the importance of these Portuguese voyages inredefining the shape of the globe as it was known to the elites of the earlymodern world. To the modern eye Ptolemy's map appears strange and unfamiliar, with its distended Africa, enlarged Asia and landlocked Indian Ocean. The Spheres globe, on the contrary, appears strikingly modern inits accurate delineation of the coastlines of Africa, its depiction of the Cape of Good Hope and its more familiar representation of the islands ofthe Indian Ocean. The globe stands as an arresting example ofthe extent towhich the Portuguese were responsible for updating global perceptions ofthe early world, as well as their own changing position within this world. Ptolemy's world picture places Portugal itself on the western edge of themap, whilst the Spheres globe vertiginously repositions these coordinatesby placing Portugal, with Lisbon at its centre, at the top of the globe, thetraditional positioning of the Terrestrial Paradise within the iconographyof medieval mappae - mundi, a daring representational move indicative ofthe confidence felt by the Portuguese in the wake of their extensive maritime adventures throughout this period. Historians ofcartography as well as navigation, shipbuilding, armamentsand commerce have appreciated the technical innovations which thesevoyages introduced to their particular fields ofspecialization as the Portuguese moved across the regions portrayed on the Spheres globe. However, more general accounts ofthe concept ofRenaissance Europe (with its heavily moralized connotations of European superiority, integrity, purity andpreoccupation with aesthetic beauty) have been reluctant to accord Portuguese exploits throughout Africa and Southeast Asia a place in what hasbeen represented as the pantheon ofthe glories ofthe civilization ofthe Renaissance. Stemming from the nineteenth - century invention of the veryidea of'Renaissance'as a historical epoch, and stretching from critics like Jacob Burckhardt to John Hale, politically and culturally influential definitions ofthe European Renaissance have tended to ignore not only the extentto which these Portuguese exploits redefined the known space of the earlymodern world, but also how they transformed a whole range ofsocial activities practised throughout early modern Europe. I These ranged from whatpeople wore and what they ate, to how they travelled and how they perceived people ofother cultures. This predominantly dismissive perceptionof Portugal's maritime empire suggests that such critics somehow perceived the Portuguese as devoid of the spirit invariably attributed to Renaissance Man, a spirit characterized by its intellectual curiosity, suspicion ofworldly wealth and, above all, its humaneness. Within this purviewthe Portuguese were seen in their imperial and commercial dealings asessentially pragmatic, ruthlessly pursuing financial gain at the expense ofahumaneness which was seen as the cornerstone of Renaissance civility. Inmany ways this perception of their activities was not wholly inaccurate. Bythe beginning ofthe sixteenth century they had established a traffic in slavesalong the coast of West Africa which was to define a model of Europeanslavery for centuries to come. This itself has nevertheless been elidedwithin the grand narratives of the Renaissance as a rather unpalatableaspect of the development of the Portuguese empire, rather than as centralto the developing economy ofearly modern Europe. A far more serious although not unconnected concern for such commentators intent on celebrating a particularly nineteenth - century conception ofthe Renaissance was the apparent lack of racial purity exhibited in theexpansion of the Portuguese seaborne empire. Steeped in contemporarytheories of racial classification, highly influential critics of what theytermed the'Age of Discovery', such as J. H. Parry and Boies Penrose, blamed the collapse ofthe empire towards the end ofthe sixteenth centuryon its toleration of miscegenation and racial intermarriage. 2 This led, theyclaimed, to a process ofracial degeneration which eroded the practical andadministrative efficiency of the Portuguese abroad. That such beliefs stillinform accounts of the rise and fall of the Portuguese empire emphasizesthe extent to which the myth ofRenaissance Man - purportedly possessedof integrity, curiosity and, above all, racial and cultural purity - still continuesimagination. Contemptuously referred to as the'Kaffirs of Europe',3 the Portuguesewere intuitively perceived to be the antithesis ofthis version ofRenaissancethe westernintellectualswayholdinto Man, and as such consigned to the periphery of accounts of'his'emergence. Predating the Columbian encounters in the Americas by severaldecades, the early Portuguese seaborne initiatives have been relegated tothe status of aberrant voyages, whose motives ran counter to the definingspirit ofRenaissance humanism, thus dooming the enterprises to failure. This chapter rejects such a version of the early Portuguese empire, inthe same vein that this book as a whole seeks to contest a version of the Renaissance which has condemned the Portuguese as exorbitant and ultimately degenerate voyagers. Rather than seeing the Portuguese and themotives which underpinned their maritime expansion as antithetical tothe ideals ofEuropean culture and the intellectual suppositions of Renaissance ideology, it traces the extent to which intellectual and commercialexchanges between Portugal and mainland Europe actually came todefine the scope of their expansion. Such an account reorients the placeofthe early Portuguese empire within the frame ofearly European cultureand society. Perhaps more significantly, it also seriously questions the continuing applicability ofthe defining values ofthe Renaissance in explainingthe enormous social, political and geographical upheavals generatedthroughout the world of the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. Ifthe Renaissance ideals of purity, integrity, disinterested enquiry and humaneness begin to look like nineteenth - century inventions designed torecuperate this period in European history, then perhaps today, ironically, it is the Portuguese, with their messy, hybrid histories ofcommercial, cultural and sexual exchanges with different cultures, who have come to moreadequately define the ethos of the early modem world. One of the most significant spheres within which the Portuguese combined learning and aesthetic beauty with commerce and long - distancetravel was within the field ofcartography.4 The massive amount of geographical, hydrographical and navigational data collected from the fleetswhich were regularly dispatched from Lisbon from the late fifteenth century began to redefine the social status of maps and charts as valuablesocial and cultural assets. Never before had mapmaking taken on such directly cognitive importance as it did in the face of charting the unknowncoastlines and regions encountered by the Portuguese on their voyagesdown the African coast and onwards into the Indian Ocean. As thewealth of geographical and navigational information grew, so the need foradequate tabulation and representation of such information increased. The result was a gradual shift in the status of maps and mapmaking. Therelative swiftness with which the Portuguese moved through the oceansbegan to redefine the temporality of map production. Older medievalmappae - mundi could still reflect the power and prestige of possession ofgeographical knowledge, but part of their arcane authority emanatedfrom the time spent by learned savants carefully piecing together theencyclopaedic information required to construct their constitutive parts. Prior to the rapidity of the seaborne voyages, the circulation of geographical knowledge, previously slowly transmitted by travellers on foot orhorseback, did not require rapid assimilation. However, the Portuguese required more immediate geographical assimilation from their maps, whichcould portray not only an aesthetic of mystery and splendour in theirmaterial presence, but could also rapidly incorporate contemporary discoveries, and hence Portugal's central involvement in changing the basicapprehension of the shape of the globe. As a result the Portuguese crown employed a collection of professionalgeographer - navigators towards the end ofthe fifteenth century who, alongwith the impact of the new technique of printing, signalled a definableshift in the output of cartography.5 Often pilots with experience of longdistance seaborne travel, they took on the mantle of learned cosmographical savants. Self - consciously styled as royal cosmographers in the pay ofthe Portuguese crown, these geographer - navigators retained the aura oflearned scholars embroiled in the mysteries of the celestial as well as theterrestrial spheres, whilst wedding their esoteric learning to the practicalfields of navigation and mapmaking. As a result, their cartographicoutput increasingly brought together the practical charts of maritimenavigation and the more ceremonial and rhetorical world maps exemplified in the imposing mappae - mundi and Ptolemaic maps commissionedby the patrons of fifteenth - century Italy. World maps such as the Cantino Planisphere combined aesthetic magnificence with the hydrographicaccuracy provided in the portolan charts which had begun to trace the Portuguese landfalls along the west coast of Africa from the early fifteenthcentury (illus. 16). Such charts lacked the visual splendour and detaileddecoration of world maps like the Planisphere, but they were vital to thepainstakingly slow process of mapping previously uncharted coastlinesdown to the last inlet and harbour. No longer relying on the learned speculation and geographical imaginativeness which characterized so manymedieval mappae - mundi, maps like the Cantino Planisphere drew on thedirect experience oforganized long - distance voyages, and the informationwhich they provided. Commercially acquisitive in their primary focus onthe location of markets and description of merchandise, such lavish worldmaps exhibited the influence ofgeographical and navigational informationgleaned from native pilots and geographers whom the Portuguese encountered on their voyages. The material value of such maps was built uponthese encounters and exchanges of knowledge, encounters which do notadhere to the classical model of assertive, civilizing and culturally pure Renaissance Man voyaging into the unknown. Nor was their value created 16 Zuane Pizzigano, portolan chart of West Africa, 1424, vellum. University of Minnesota, Minneapolis. from the realm ofa pure and disinterested aesthetic expunged of politicalor commercial influence. On the contrary, the value of maps like the Cantino Planisphere stemmed from their significance as commercial objectsimbued with the ethos of long - distance travel inspired by the search forelusive markets in precious and scarce merchandise, such as the'seedpearls and grapes and figs and silk and dates and almonds and alum andhorses,6 with which the Planisphere demarcated commercially lucrativecities like Hormuz at the entrance to the Persian Gulf Combiningaesthetic splendour with financial gain, the maps exemplified the commercial and acquisitive impetus of the Portuguese seaborne empire, animpetus which has been interpreted too reductively in classical narrativesof the Renaissance. In tracing the production and distribution of thesemaps, this chapter offers an alternative account of the status of the Portuguese within narratives of the constitution of early modem Europe, anddemonstrates the crucial part that mapmaking played in this process. 'Terra Incognita ': The Early Portuguese Voyages Evidence of early fifteenth - century Portuguese involvement with traditional mappae - mundi suggests thatthe crown was well aware of therhetorical and encyclopaedic value of maps and their claims to universalcomprehensiveness. In 1428 the Portuguese prince Dom Pedro returnedfrom an official diplomatic mission which took him to England, Flanders, Germany and Italy. Whilst in Venice the seigniory presented him with ajewel valued at 1,000 ducats, along with a manuscript copy of Marco Polo's travels in the east and a mappa - mundi. The sixteenth - centurychronicler Duarte Galvao recorded Dom Pedro's travels in his memoirspublished in 1563, where he recalled that the prince:... came home by Italie, taking Rome & Venice in his way: from whence hebrought a map of the world, which had all the parts of the world and earthdescribed. The streight of Magellan was called in it The Dragons taile: The Cape of Bona Speran~a, the forefront of Afrike, and so foorth of other places? Galvao clearly superimposed the results ofthe voyages around the Cape of Good Hope and through the Strait of Magellan upon Dom Pedro's mapnearly a century before their actual occurrence in an attempt to emphasizeits modernity. Notwithstanding these anachronistic additions, this story ofthe traffic in decorative mappae - mundi between Venice and Portugalunderlines a crucial point in the early development of Portuguese apprehensions of cartography. The relationship between jewel, travel, book andmap is indicative of the ways in which such precious material objects wereperceived by both the Venetian and the Portuguese ambassadorial delegations as constitutive of the imaginative and intellectual processes requiredto deal with the vicissitudes ofunknown, and hence potentially dangerous, long - distance travel. The Venetians were well aware that Dom Pedro hadalready been active in his sponsorship of Portuguese voyages down thewest coast of Africa. The intellectual and logistical apparatuses whichthey believed were required for such expeditions are vividly encapsulatedin the presentation of both book and map, whilst the jewel is tantalizinglyevocative of the potentially lucrative rewards which awaited the successfullong - distance traveller. Nor were the Portuguese ignorant of the politicaladvantages ofsurrounding themselves with the vestiges ofesoteric geographicallearning. Dom Pedro's brother Dom Henrique (better known by his Anglicized name'Henry the Navigator') had already employed the revered Mallorcan cartographerJafuda Cresques, one of the mapmakers responsible for the creation of Baldassare degli Ubriachi's mappae - mundi in Barcelona in 1400, to provide. mappae - mundi for the Portuguese court (although little is known of Cresques'subsequent output). In 1457 Henrique's nephew Affonso V commissioned the Italian cartographer Fra Mauro to construct his vast mappa - mundi, discussed in Chapter One, which for the first time incorporated details of Portuguese voyages downthe west coast of Africa into the relatively homogeneous world picturereproduced in so many late medieval mappae - mundi. Completed in 1459, the map was delivered to the Portuguese court upon payment ofsixty - twoducats. These appropriations emphasize the extent to which the Portuguese were fully aware of the symbolic power of decorative mapsclaiming access to universal orders of knowledge. However, the logisticaldifficulties associated with the increasingly long - distance oceanic voyageswhich the Portuguese court began to sponsor in the first half of the fifteenth century gradually superseded the highly speculative informationwhich made up such medieval mappae - mundi, and led to the developmentof new forms of cartographic representation. The bases upon which the Portuguese seaborne empire laid its foundation had from the beginning stemmed from the navigational andhydrographical problems involved in sailing in waters and along coastlines which neither Ptolemy's Geographia nor Mediterranean portolancharts were equipped to comprehend. Facing outwards onto a predominantly uncharted northern Atlantic, the Portuguese were in many wayswell - situated geographically to initiate a policy of seaborne explorationdown the west coast ofAfrica, and away from the Muslim - dominated territories of North Africa. However, at the same time they were technicallyill - equipped to deal with the logistical problems which such explorationinvolved. Established mapping practices were of little help in these earlyvoyages. Whilst to some extent Ptolemy's geographical data had dealtwith Africa, this was confined to hazy regional information which onlyreached as far as'Ethiopia' (placed on Ptolemaic maps deep in the southern interior). The western coastline remained uncharted, whilst territoryfurther to the south was simply labelled'Terra Incognita'. Similarly, theportolan charts used by merchants and sailors throughout the Mediterranean had neither the geographical range nor technical expertise to be ofuse to Portuguese pilots navigating their way through unknown seas anduncharted coasts. Mediterranean portolan charts conformed to the specifications of conditions unique to that particular sea. Following theminvariably involved'coastwise'sailing, which relied on acquired knowledge of local winds and currents, and the recognition of definablecoastal landmarks, markers which were often written into the descriptiveaccounts which supplemented the charts. Because of the relatively smalllatitudinal range of the Mediterranean, pilots rarely calculated their latitude whilst sailing, relying instead on'plain sailing', navigating along astraight line (or'rhumb') marked on the chart, which linked one coastallocation to another.8 Charts such as Albertin de Virga's 1409 portolan (illus. 17) are typical of those used to assist in this type of navigation. The elaborate network of rhumb lines which crisscross the chart connectthe commercial and political world of the Mediterranean, focusing on Venice, Flanders, Alexandria and the Greek islands, carving out a series 17 A1bertin de Virga, portolan chart of the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, 1409, vellum. Bibliotheque Nationale de France, Paris (Charts and Plans). of definable maritime trade routes along which pilots could navigate withsome confidence. The Portuguese, however, soon realized that this type of navigation, using charts such as de Virga's, was inadequate for the conditions they encountered on their early voyages. The islands of the Atlantic, and the westcoast of Africa, offered few readily identifiable landmarks for orientation, whilst sailing in the open sea provided even greater problems. The windsand currents of the Atlantic made coastal sailing a hazardous venture. Yetlong - distance oceanic voyages across the natural curvature of the globemade navigation along a straight rhumb line of the type employed in de Virga's chart increasingly difficult. Journeys between two fixed points onthe earth's surface had to take into account the curvature of the globe. Onshort journeys through the Mediterranean this was not too much ofa problem, as the relative distortion of the earth's curve produced by a straightline was minimal, and often corrected by location ofcoastal features. However, this distortion increased across longer distances, such as the Atlanticvoyages undertaken by the Portuguese. Pilots increasingly discovered thatsailing along a straight line of bearing often left them off - course by severalleagues, which made accurate navigation and chartmaking even more difficult. The solution to this problem was the establishment of accuratemethods to determine latitude by reference to the sun and the starswhilst at sea and out of sight of land.9 In so doing the Portuguese couldcalculate their position in relation to the nearest coastline and hence theirrelative distance from their point of departure. By the middle of the fifteenth century commentators began to noticethe astronomical developments initiated by Portuguese pilots and cosmographers in the search for reliable methods of oceanic navigation. The German ambassador to the Portuguese court in the 1450S noted in his account of the voyages that there were, 'in addition to the pilots... masterastrologers, very knowledgeable of the routes according to the stars andthe Pole'.Io By the 1470S the Portuguese were extensively using astrolabesand quadrants to determine latitude at sea, and in 1478 the Jewish astronomer Abraham Zacuto circulated his highly influential manuscript the Almanach perpetuum. Zacuto's text contained four tables which calculatedthe position of the sun every day from 1473 to 1476, the coordinates beingprovided for the hour of noon for the day and place where the calculationwas made. Allowing for even greater precision in the establishment ofaccurate calculations of latitude, such apparently esoteric information wasdeemed to be ofsuch value that not only was it widely circulated in manuscript form, but it was also increasingly disseminated in print. By the earlysixteenth century entrepreneurs had begun to issue solar tables based on Zacuto's calculations. One such entrepreneur was the German merchantand printer Valentim Fernandes. The frontispiece to his Reportorio dos Tempos (illus. 18), published at his Lisbon printing press in 1518, is indicative ofthe intellectual and political significance ofthese tables. The learnedgeographical savant displays the method of calculating the altitude of thesun to the Portuguese king Manuel I. Dwarfing the two figures is the armilIary sphere, signifying the fruitful union between celestial andterrestrial learning and the ultimate symbol of the Portuguese empireitself, a motif which recurs throughout Portuguese iconography of theperiod, and which was to dominate the design ofthe Spheres tapestry commissioned by Manuel's son Joao III several years later. The effect ofsuch relatively sophisticated technical and scientific developments upon maps of the period was significant. The portolan chartdrawn by the Portuguese cartographer Pedro Reinel and dated 1483 (illus. 19) shows with startling accuracy the extent of Portugal's maritimeactivity throughout the Atlantic and along the coast of West Africa by thebeginning of the 1480s. The nine Azores islands are all accurately positioned on Reinel's map, as are the Canary Islands, Madeira and the Cape Verde archipelago. But for the first time the map shows with expert precision the location of the four islands of the Gulf of Guinea and, inparticular, the island of Sao Tome, a pivotalftitoria, or trading station, in Portugal's growing commercial network along the west coast of Africa.

Perhaps even more significantly, by 1500 Portuguese chartmakers began to incorporate scales oflatitude intotheir charts of the area. The anonymous chart dated 1500 (illus. 20), which covers much of the territory depicted in Reinel's earlier chart, contains for the first time in the history ofcartography a scale oflatitude from 18 to 61, covering the territories from Cape Verde in the south to Flanders in the north. II This is the first chart known to incorporate scales oflatitude into its overall design, and as such is a striking example of theways in which, even at this early stage, Portuguese maritime cartographyunited the symbolics of territorial possession (graphically articulated inthe flags which define territorial sovereignty across its surface) with alevel of practical navigational precision unparalleled in the history of theearly modem mapping oflong - distance seaborne travel. The scientific and intellectual advances made by the Portuguese withinthe field ofastronomy and navigation were central to both the progress oftheir seaborne voyages along the coast ofWest Africa and the developmentofmore accurate maps and charts of the territories encountered as a result 19 Pedro Reinel, portolan chart ofWest Africa, 1483, ink on parchment.

However, care must be taken in interpreting theseadvances within the grand imperial narratives of'discovery'and'colonization'. The Portuguese term for discovery, 'descobrimento', was in factincreasingly utilized throughout this period to define the technical achievements of the Portuguese navigational developments as much as theterritories to which such achievements provided access. [2'Possession'wasbased not on territories occupied but on the monopolization of logisticaland navigational information which established precedence in the creationofcommercial sea routes and specific trading points. What primarily motivated these early initiatives was therefore not a desire to'discover'andcolonize territory, but a drive towards commercial expansion. From 1419, when Portuguese ships landed on the Madeira Islands and claimed themfor the crown, the fleets dispatched from Lisbon pursued a vigorously commercial agenda. In 1427 ships landed on and subsequently claimed the Azores and by 1434 the Portuguese crown claimed sovereignty over the Canaries. Whilst the term'conquest'is often applied to Portugal's involvement with these islands, care must be taken when assuming that suchconquest simply translated into the terms of territorial possession whichcharacterized later eighteenth - and nineteenth - century European claimsto imperial possession throughout Africa and Southeast Asia. Orthodox Christian doctrine stipulated that newly discovered territories populatedby peoples unaware of, or antithetical to, Christianity could be justifiablyclaimed on behalfofa global Christianity. However, such edicts operated asconvenient frameworks for early Portuguese exploration rather than as prescriptive imperatives in the name ofan all - powerful Christian imperialism. Similarly, the novelty ofthe supposed conquest ofpreviously unknown territory by sea was very different from the model of territorial'conquest'ofdefinable territories by land which had preoccupied the armed forces of Christendom throughout the Middle Ages. For the fifteenth - century Portuguese, 'conquest'often signified the establishment of maritime tradingroutes, the construction of strategic trading stations and the monopolization ofspecific goods for export, contingent responses to the impossibilityof manning larger garrisons and imposing a substantial and systematiccolonial administration. Early chronicles of Portuguese involvement withthe Atlantic islands repeatedly stress the establishment ofthe monopolization of the movement of goods to be found in the islands, such as animalskins, fish, wood, sugar and salt. Even when the rationale for such commercial exploits was couched in the language of religious justification, theconcept of acquisition and profit remained central to the principles ofexpansion. In his Cronica do descobrimento e conquista da Guini, completedin 1453, the Portuguese chronicler Gomes Eannes de Azurara noted that Dom Henrique supported the pursuit of involvement in the Atlanticislands for very specific reasons: For he perceived that no better offering could be made unto the Lord than this; for if God promised to return one hundred goods for one, we may justly believethat for such great benefits, that is to say for so many souls as were saved by theefforts ofthis Lord, he will have so many hundreds ofguerdons in the KingdomofGod. I3 The language of investment and profit which suffuses Azurara's account issymptomatic of the ethos of Portuguese exploration throughout thisperiod, be it in the traffic in souls, or in the traffic in sugar. Assisted by the improved astronomical and navigational aids providedby figures like Zacuto, subsequent seaborne expansion was rapid. Averaging over one degree south a year, Portuguese expeditions rounded Cape Bojador in 1434, opening up trade with the Guinea coast. In 1435 the tropicof Cancer was crossed, and by 1460 the Cape Verde Islands had beenreached. Between 1472 and 1475 the islands of Sao Tome and Principewere sighted in the Gulf of Guinea, and in 1473 the equator was crossedby Portuguese ships for the first time. In 1482 the ftitoria of Sao Jorge da Mina was established on the Guinea coast, and by 1488 Bartolomeu Diashad rounded the Cape of Good Hope. It was this event which conclusivelydispelled the Ptolemaic belief that the Indian Ocean was a landlocked sea, and subsequently opened the way for Portuguese involvement in theproliferation oftrading networks which stretched from the eastern coast of Africa to the islands of the Indonesian archipelago. At every point of thisremarkable dispersion of the Portuguese seaborne empire, the process ofmapping and the expansion of commercial possibilities went hand inhand. In 1469 Affonso V, having already sponsored the production ofFra Mauro's enormous mappa - mundi in 1459, awarded a trading monopolyalong the Guinea coast to the Lisbon merchant - explorer Fernao Gomes, an agreement described byJoao de Barros in the account ofthe Portuguesein West Africa contained in his chronicles Da Asia: As the king was very occupied with the affairs of the kingdom, and was not satisfied to cultivate this trade himself nor let it run as it was, he leased it onrequest in fourteen hundred and sixty - nine to Fernao Gomes, a respected citizen of Lisbon, for five years, at two hundred thousand reis a year, on conditionthat in each ofthese five years he should engage to discover one hundred leaguesofcoast farther on, so that at the end of the lease five hundred leagues should bediscovered, beginning from Serra Leoa... And among other terms for this contract was that all the ivory should be delivered to the king at the price of onethousand five hundred reis per hundredweight... Also the traffic of Arguimwas excluded, because the king had given it to his son, Prince D. Joao, as partof his revenue. I4 Affonso's contract with Gomes united maritime discovery and territorialmapping with the new mechanisms of long - distance trade and exchangerequired to extract maximum financial benefit from the new commercialpossibilities created by Portuguese dealings with West Africa, and in particular the lucrative trade with the ports and islands of Guinea. As well asproviding the ivory stipulated in the agreement, the Guinea trade also sawslaves, pepper, musk and gold flowing back into the markets of Portugal. The maps and charts which facilitated this diversification in mechanismsof both trade and merchandise accrued a new social and political status asprized objects in their own right, startlingly vivid material objects whichwere symptomatic of the impact these new techniques of long - distancetravel and commercial acquisition had on the growing prosperity and political importance of both the Portuguese crown and its merchants. The map was therefore situated at the nexus of these new forms oftravel, exchange and acquisition, a point which was stressed in varioustravel accounts published throughout this period on the nature ofthe Portuguese incursions along the coast of West Africa. In 1455 the Venetianmerchant Alvise Cadamosto took a share in a crown - sponsored initiativeto trade along the coast of Senegal. Upon landing there and trading withthe locals, he noted of them that: They were also struck with admiration by the construction of the ship, and byher equipment - mast, sails, rigging, and anchor... They said we must begreat wizards, almost the equal of the devil, for men that journey by land havedifficulty in knowing the way from place to place, while we journeyed by sea, and, as they were given to understand, remained out of sight of land for manydays, yet knew which direction to take, a thing only possible through thepower of the devil. This appeared so to them because they do not understand the artofnavigation, the compass, or the chart. 15 Cadamosto's comments say more about his own wonder at the benefits ofthe compass and the chart than that supposedly exhibited by the local inhabitants. For a merchant like Cadamosto, used to the plain sailingmethods adopted in the waters of the Mediterranean, the ability to sail inopen sea for extended periods of time using charts and celestial observations must have seemed as fabulous as the goods which he eventuallyshipped back to Venice via Lisbon. Clearly aware of the advantages ofthese new developments in the fields ofnavigation and cartography, Cadamosto did not only return to Venice with the commodities for which hetraded along the coast of Senegal. He also arrived back in his native cityin 1463 with maps and hydrographic information which he supplied tothe Venetian cartographer Grazioso Benincasa. In 1467 Benincasa produced an atlas of portolan charts, including a remarkably up - to - datechart of the coastline ofWest Africa which reproduced Cadamosto's written observations on his journey down the coast, point by point (illus. 21). Whilst lacking the opulent decoration of earlier mappae - mundi, charts like Benincasa's began to move along the same trade routes as the goods towhich they provided access. Lacking the esoteric quality of the earliermappae - mundi, they nevertheless established an aura of value precisely interms of the potential commercial benefit they could provide for theirowners. As a result, such charts took their place within a rarefied marketplace peopled by merchants, commercially minded sovereigns and chartmakers, who were no longer in search of the geographical speculationprovided by mappae - mundi but were instead searching for specific hydrographic and commercial information with which to launch long - distancetrading ventures. As a result ofthe early Portuguese voyages down the westcoast of Africa, the perception of marine cartography changed for ever. Mapmaking became tied to the exigencies of commercial expansion, which came to define the shape of early modern cartography as it beganto chart systematically the territories to the south and east of mainland Europe over the following decades. The Myth ofa Renaissance Man: Henry and His Navigators Cadamosto's voyage down the coast of Senegal had been sanctioned by Dom Henrique, on condition that Cadamosto paid halfofany subsequent 21 Grazioso Benincasa, portolan chart of West Africa and islands, 1467, vellum. Bibliotheque Nationale de France, Paris (Charts and Plans). profits from his venture to Henrique. Cadamosto's encounter with the Portuguese prince has been seen as just one of the many examples of theapparently enlightened pioneering spirit ofDom Henrique. Historians ofthe so - called'Age of Discovery'have enshrined him, above all other Portuguese figures, as an archetypal Renaissance Man, grandly dubbing him'Henry the Navigator' (illus. 22). Supposedly exhibiting the classical virtues ofpiety, learning and patriotic pride, Dom Henrique has been seen as the one potentially recuperablefigure in the history ofearly Portuguese maritime expansion, singlehand - 22 Dom Henrique (Prince Henry the Navigator), detail from Nuno Gon<;aJves, panel of the Infante, from the Veneration of St Vincent, c. 1471 - 81, oil on panel. Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga, Lisbon. to transplantedly responsible for not only the spread of the spirit of humanist enquiryand scientific learning in Portugal, but also the organized drive to find anavigable sea route to India. He has been portrayed as being, between 1415 and his death in 1460, the driving force behind the Portuguesevoyages down the coast of Africa. The myth ofDom Henrique as the erudite scholar - prince was primarily established by nineteenth - century Portuguese historiography, which was anxiousthe Burckhardtian model ofRenaissance Man into the history ofthe early Portuguese seaborne empire, in an attempt to emphasize Portugal's missao decivilizacao in the face ofanti - colonial struggles against Portuguese authority.16 Claims that Henrique established an academy devoted to the study ofastronomy and navigation at Sagres on the southern coast of Portugal, where he surrounded himself with some of the greatest scientific mindsofthe period, are unsubstantiated by any contemporary chronicles that recount his life and career. The outlandishness of such claims as to Henrique's learned wisdom stretched as far as some commentators confidently asserting that he read the work of the German astronomer Regiomontanus, whose work was printed over twenty years after Henrique's death! The prince's reputation primarily rests on the admiringaccount offered in Azurara's Cronica do descobrimento e conquista da Guine (although even here no mention is made of his scientific interests). However, Azurara appears to have deliberately painted him in a positive light asa result of his loyalty to King Affonso V in 1449, when his brother Dom Pedro briefly challenged Affonso for the crown. As Azurara's chroniclewas written under the patronage of the king, it is hardly surprising that Dom Henrique is portrayed as a wise and loyal prince. There is no doubt that Dom Henrique was at the forefront of sponsoring Portuguese voyages into the Atlantic and down the coast of Africa. However, his motives for supporting such expeditions were much morepragmatic than has previously been believed. Rather than seeking tocombat the Muslim'infidel'and convert'heathens'to the virtues of Christianity, the chronicles of the period indicate that Henrique was in fact farmore interested in establishing his own commercial control of the territories claimed by the early Portuguese voyages. As early as 1439 hesecured a grant from King Duarte giving him commercial control overthe Madeiras, and by the 1440s, as Azurara notes, his thoughts hadturned to the Canary Islands: In the year 1446 the Infant [Dom Henrique] began to make ready his ships toreturn to the said conquest [of the Canaries], but before doing aught in thesame, he requested the Infant Dom Pedro, his brother, who at that time wasruling the kingdom in the name of the King, to give him a letter forbidding allthe subjects of these realms from daring to go to the Canary Islands, to war ortreat of merchandise, without the command of the said Infant. This letter wasgranted him, and beside this he was privileged to enjoy a fifth whatever shouldbe brought from there; and this was very rightly given him, considering thegreat expense which that noble Prince had incurred in the matter of the saidconquest. 17 Earlier in the same year Henrique had secured rights to all trade beyond Cape Bojador on the west coast of Africa, and by the time of his death in 1460 he had established commercial monopolies on fishing, soap and dyemaking throughout the Atlantic islands and on the African coast. A goodexample of his commercial preoccupations emerges from a grant he issuedto a prominent member of his retinue, Bartolomeu Perestrelo, who informed him of the commercial possibilities offered by the islands of Madeira and Porto Santo. In 1446 Henrique drew up a grant allocating Perestrelo certain rights to Madeira, of which the prince was to take a cut. They give an idea of what he saw as the benefits of settling such an apparently insignificant island: Furthermore, it is my pleasure that the said Bartolomeu Perestrelo have forhimselfall grain mills in the said island, which I hereby give him in charge; andno one but he or whoever he permits may construct mills, except hand millswhich may be built by anyone who wishes, but not for the purpose of millingfor others, nor may anyone build a horse or water - powered mill except he himselfor whoever has his approval. Item: it is my pleasure that he may collect waterrights ofone mark ofsilver or its equivalent yearly from everybody or two planksevery week of those customarily sawed, paying to us, however, the tenth of allsuch lumber, in the same way as is paid for other products of the said sawmill, and that Bartolomeu Perestrelo have also the same rights from any other millthat may be built there, excluding veins of iron ore or other metals. Item: it ismy pleasure that he have all baking ovens that are equipped with vats... Item: it is my pleasure that if he has salt for sale nobody but he may sell salt... Furthermore, it is my pleasure that he have the tenth of everything that isowed to me as income from the island. I8 However effective such a decree proved to be in practice, it established amodel of commercial monopolization which was to characterize Portuguese mercantile activity for the next hundred years. 19 The picture of Henrique's exploits which emerges from contemporarysources indicates that, rather than being a confident, crusading Renaissance Man, he deftly turned the logistical difficulties of long - distanceseaborne travel to his own highly specific, and deeply single - minded, commercial ends. Henrique realized that political power and authority did notlie in claiming huge tracts of ungovernable territory, but in the strategicand highly pragmatic commercial monopolization of key ports and islands. The limited number of maps and charts which emerged fromthese initiatives were therefore not the result of the flowering ofa dynamichumanist impulse in Portugal at the behest ofthe learned Henrique. Theywere, in fact, logistical objects facilitating the commercial development ofthe prince's own network of trading interests. Nor were these trading interests limited to the singular expansion ofthe Portuguese economy. They had ramifications well beyond Portugal. As Dom Henrique's commercial agreement with the Venetian merchant Cadamosto makes clear, the prince was fully aware of the need for financialdiversification in the development oftrade throughout the Atlantic islandsand along the coast ofAfrica in order to maximize the territories'economicpotential. The Portuguese crown had neither the capital nor the commercial experience required to capitalize on these new, if geographicallydistant, markets. Dom Henrique therefore fostered commercial exchangeswith mainland Europe, and in particular the trading ports of Italy, in anattempt to draw financial investment into the African and Atlantic trades. In 1447 the Genoese merchant Antoine Malfante drew up an agreementwith Henrique which allowed him to trade around the mouth of the Niger river, and in 1455 his fellow Genoese merchant Antoniotto Usodimare was granted rights to trade along the coast of Senegal. 20 Thesecommercial exchanges between mainland Europe and Portugal can betraced in the surviving charts of the period, which indicate the extent towhich the commercial developments of the Portuguese discoveries wererapidly assimilated into a wider European network of finance and ex In 1448 the Venetian cartographer Andrea Bianco drew achange. portolan chart which depicted for the very first time Portuguese navigationbeyond Cape Bojador (illus. 23). However, it was not completed in Lisbon. 'I'he author's legend states that Bianco finalized the chart in London, onhis way to Flanders from Venice, having already stopped en route in Lisbon. Bianco's journey became a standard trade route followed by merchants from southern Europe, who were keen to invest in Portuguesevoyages down the coast of Africa and out into the Atlantic, and shippedgoods traded in these locations to the marts of northern Europe and, inparticular, London and Flanders. Bianco's chart imparts the news of the Portuguese discoveries and connects them to the trade routes linking Italy, Lisbon, Africa and Flanders in one continuous line of coastal territory. Whilst his chart was not necessarily produced for commercialnavigation, it does, along with several other similar ones of the period, seem to have been the type used by pilots navigating along these traderoutes with the commercial support of the Portuguese crown and, morespecifically, Dom Henrique. The commercial agreements Henriquemade with Venetian and Genoese merchants established a structure ofcommercial exchanges which defined the expansion of the Atlantic and African trade well into the sixteenth century. By the 1470S Florentine merchants such as Benedetto Dei were trading deep into the interior of West Africa with Portuguese consent; and by 1479 Flemish merchants like Eustache de la Fosse were establishing trading links with the Portugueseftitorias in the Gulf of Guinea. 21 As a result, by the end of the fifteenthcentury a third of all sugar production coming out of Madeira was beingexported to the Low Countries, with the revenue from such trading rightsgoing straight into the coffers of the Portuguese crown. 22 Dom Henrique was not the ideal Renaissance Man ofthe Burckhardtianimagination, nor was he steeped in the learned mysteries of science andastronomy. Critical attempts to foreground his cultural achievements asan enthusiastic patron of scholarly activity, over and above his drive towards financial expansion and commercial diversification, have sought toseparate the pursuit of scholarship from the pursuit of commercial gain. Henrique's career (and the range of intellectual and technological initiatives which emerged within Portugal around this period) emphasizesthat, particularly for the early Portuguese voyagers, no such simplistic distinction existed. The process by which the advances made by the Portuguese throughout the fifteenth century were mapped across thecharts and global maps of the period is symptomatic of how scholarship. - ' 23 Andrea Bianco, portolanchart ofEurope and West Africa, 1448. Biblioteca AnIbrosiana, Milan.,... - ~. - and commerce were mutually supportive activities in defining the earlymodern world picture as it emerged as a result of the voyages into the Atlantic and down the coast of Africa. IfDom Henrique can be said to beresponsible in any way for the momentous changes which occurred in thisworld picture, it was through his attempts to fill the gaps in a changingcommercial market rather than those on the unfolding map of the earlymodern world. Maps and Monopolies: The Portuguese in the Indian Ocean By the 1480s the growing success of the commercial ventures initiated by Henrique allowed for increased expenditure on voyages seeking a navigable sea route from Portugalto the spice and pepper markets of Southeast Asia, whose merchandise slowly and expensively trickled intomainland Europe via the Red Sea and overland trade routes through Ottoman - controlled Asia. By 1485 Joao II confidently announced in hisoration to Pope Innocent VIII delivered in Rome:... the by no means uncertain hope of exploring the Barbarian Gulf, wherekingdoms and nations of Asiatics, barely known among us and then only by themost meager of information, practice very devoutly the most holy faith of the Saviour. The farthest limit of Lusitanian maritime exploration is at presentonly a few days distant from them, if the most competent geographers are buttelling the truth. As a matter of fact, by far the greatest part of the circuit of Africa being by then already completed, our men last year reached Prassum Promontorium, where the Barbarian Gulfbegins, having explored all rivers, shoresand ports over a distance that is reckoned at more than forty - five hundred milesfrom Lisbon, according to very accurate observation of the sea, lands, andstars. 23 Like Dom Henrique before him,Joao's account ofPortuguese navigationalachievement was consistently couched in the rhetoric of Christian expansionism, as befitted the audience to whom it was addressed. Yet theemphasis in Joao's oration is quite clearly placed on announcing the geographical and technological extent of the Portuguese discoveries, as theyexceeded the limits of Ptolemaic knowledge, reaching people'barelyknown among us', and stretching as far as the'Prassum Promontorium', the most southerly point reached by the Portuguese in 1484. However, the one cartographic artefact which came to encapsulate the extent of the Portuguese discoveries prior to the successful passage around the Cape of Good Hope in 1488 was a terrestrial globe designed not by a Portuguesegeographer, but by a merchant from Nuremberg. In 1484, the same year that Joao composed his oration on the extent ofthe Portuguese discoveries in Africa, Martin Behaim, a cloth merchantfrom Nuremberg, arrived in Lisbon, ostensibly to capitalize on the commercial incentives which had been established by Dom Henrique forforeign merchants keen to exploit the trading possibilities offered alongthe African coast. He subsequently claimed to have sailed with the Portuguese commander Diogo Cao as far south as the tropic of Capricornbetween 1482 and 1484. Little is known of Behaim's putative exploits in Portugal and West Africa, but his experience was clearly impressiveenough for the burghers of Nuremberg to commission him to produce aterrestrial globe upon his return to the city in 1490 (illus. 24). Behaim wasapproached by George Holzschuher, a prominent financier who heldmonopolies on silver mining throughout the region. As a businessman involved in the trade in precious metals, it is not surprising that Holzschuhershould have taken such a keen interest in Behaim's first - hand account ofthe burgeoning gold trade which had sprung up along the west coast of Africa. Behaim's claims to commercial involvement and navigational expertise throughout this region suggested that he possessed the requisiteskills to produce a material object worthy ofthe investment which the burghers of Nuremberg were prepared to make in the terrestrial globe, as wellas being able to provide the city's merchants with the valuable commercial 24 Detail of Europe and the Near East from iIIus 3. information they required to break into the lucrative trade along the African coast. Detailed documentation recording the production of the globe indicates thatit was a costly and time - consuming commission. Behaiminitially drew up a basic manuscript mappa - mundi design as a workingmodel from which to complete his globe. This map was designed to ahighly decorative standard, as it subsequently adorned the walls of the Nuremberg council chamber. Assisted by an array of painters and craftsmen, Behaim spent over two years supervising the production of theglobe, which was subsequently completed sometime prior to his returnto Lisbon in July 1493. Estimates calculate that it cost the Nurembergcouncil the equivalent of 13 17S which, considering the amount of workinvolved, was a particularly good price for what was to prove to be the firstknown terrestrial globe made in early modern Europe. 24 - The final dimensions of the globe were no less impressive than thetrouble taken in its commissioning and construction. With a diameter of 50 em, mounted on a stand and richly illustrated in a range of colours, itretains to this day the imposing appearance it must have possessed at thetime of its unveiling. The globe contained a proliferation of visual as wellas written information (in Latin). It amassed a total of l,roO place namesand depicted 48 flags (ro of them Portuguese), 15 coats of arms and 48 miniatures of kings and local rulers. Daring in its size and scale, Behaim'sglobe also dramatically displayed the full extent of Portuguese voyagesdown the coast of Africa, showing evidence that he was at least aware of Bartolomeu Dias'voyage round the Cape of Good Hope in 1488. On Behaim's globe Africa is no longer depicted as a continuous landmassrunning into Asia, as portrayed in early printed editions ofPtolemy's Geographia. Instead, southern Africa is boldly portrayed as a navigable pointoffering access to an open Indian Ocean. Not only was this the first strikingly secular terrestrial globe depicting the momentous changes which thetraditional Ptolemaic world picture was experiencing, but it was also one ofthe first definitively global geographical images to place Africa as central, rather than peripheral, to the political and commercial world of earlymodem Europe. What is most striking about the production of the globe is the extent towhich Behaim's apparent commercial expertise in distant places allowedhim to acquire the status of geographical specialist, rather than vice versa. For both the Portuguese crown and the Nuremberg burghers, it was thisthat enhanced his prestige as a geographer and, ultimately, globemaker. Shortly after his arrival in Lisbon in 1484, Behaim had been invited tojoin the Junta dos mathematicos, a group of Portuguese pilots and cosmographers assigned the task of developing more accurate calculations oflatitude through solar observation. His intellectual qualifications for sucha post appear to have been little more than a dubious claim to have studiedbriefly under the German astronomer Regiomontanus. What seems tohave motivated the Portuguese in offering Behaim such a position was hiscommercial knowledge, rather than his intellectual credentials. Similarly, the burghers of Nuremberg seem to have been more interested in commissioning a terrestrial globe from the highly partial standpoint of a German merchant versed in long - distance travel, rather than from an experienced pilot or cosmographer more familiar with the arcane mysteriesof cosmography and geography. The good burghers were presumably notdisappointed with the detailed information which covers the globe. In anextensive legend, adjacent to the meticulous delineation of the west coastof Africa, Behaim managed not only to provide a primarily commercialreport of the area, but was also astute enough to insert his own identityinto the narrative: In the year 1484 after the birth of Christ our Lord, the Serene King John II of Portugal caused to be fitted out two vessels called caraveli, which were found andarmed for three years. These vessels were ordered to sail past the columns which Hercules had set up in Africa, always to the south and towards sunrise, and as faras they possibly could. The above king likewise supplied these vessels with various goods and merchandise for sale and barter. The ships also carried 18 horseswith costly harness, to be presented to Moorish Kings where we thought fit. Wewere also given various examples of spices to be shown to the Moors in orderthat they might understand what we sought in their country. Thus fitted outwe sailed from the port of Lisbon in Portugal to the Island Madeira, where thesugar of Portugal grows, and through the Fortunate Islands and those of thesavage Canarians. And we found Moorish Kings to whom we gave presents, for which they gave return presents. And we came to the kingdoms of Gambiaand Golof, where grow the grains of paradise, and which are distant 800 German miles from Portugal. And subsequently we arrived in King Furfur'scountry [Benin], which is 1,200 leagues or miles distant, and where grows thepepper called Portugal pepper. And far from there we came to a country wherewe found cinnamon growing. 25 Offering hydrographic information, details of merchandise to be purchased and the etiquette of pragmatic exchanges of goods with Muslimrulers, Behaim's globe was not a document ofcolonial territorial expansionbut a highly complex representation of a network of territories, ports, goods and people involved in an evolving commercial world. Nor were these lines of commercial exchange which crisscrossed theglobe limited to the trade along the coast of Africa. East of the southerntip ofAfrica the nomenclature appended to the territories marked for specific attention indicated the extent of Portuguese commercial ambitionsonce a navigable sea route to Southeast Asia, or the'Indies', had beenfound. Deep in the Indian Ocean Behaim placed a lengthy legend detailing with remarkable accuracy the commercial distribution of spicesthroughout the region: Item, be it known that spices pass through several hands in the islands of oriental India before they reach our country. I. First, the inhabitants of the island called Java Major buy them in the otherislands where they are collected by their neighbours, and sell them in their ownisland. 2. Secondly, those from the island Seilan, where St. Thomas is buried, buy thespices in Java and bring them to their own island. 3. Thirdly, in the Island Ceylon or Seilan they are once more unloaded, chargedwith Customs duty, and sold to the merchants of the island Aurea Chersonesus, where they are again unladen. 4. Fourthly, the merchants ofthe island Taprobana buy the spices there, and paythe Customs duties, and take them to their island. 5. Fifthly, the Mohammedan heathen of Aden go there, buy the spices, pay the Customs and take them to their country. 6. Sixthly, those of Cairo buy them, and carry them over the sea, and furtheroverland. 7. Seventhly, those of Venice and others buy them. 8. Eighthly, they are again sold in Venice to the Germans, and customs are paid. 9. Ninthly, at Frankfurt, Bruges and other places. 10. Tenthly, in England and France. II. Eleventh, thus at last they reach the hands of the retail traders. 12. Twelfthly, those who use the spices buy them of the retail dealers, and let thehigh customs duties profits be borne in mind which are levied twelve times uponthe spices, the former amounting on each occasion to one pound out of everyten. From this it is to be understood that very great quantities must grow inthe East and it need not be wondered that they are worth with us as much asgold. 26 With an astute eye to the complexities of long - distance trading practices, Behaim had quickly grasped the lucrative nature of the Asian spice trade. Spices were a relatively light and easily transportable commodity, with apotentially enormous domestic demand in mainland Europe. However, because of the complexities of the movement of spices in bulk, their pricecould increase almost twelvefold due to the duties placed on their transportation as they moved from the islands of the Indonesian archipelagoto the marts of northern Europe. Behaim was clearly aware that the establishment of a seaborne passage to the vast trading emporia of Southeast Asia would give the Portuguese unique access to the trade in spices, thuscircumventing the lengthy and costly overland trade routes through the Middle East and the Mediterranean which had previously brought themto Venice at such vastly inflated prices. The globe therefore operated asboth a statement of intent on behalf of the rapidly moving Portuguesevoyages, and an incentive to German financiers to invest in the commercial advances of the Portuguese which, it was hoped, would make themovement of spices through Venice a thing of the past. At the same time as Behaim's globe was being completed, news began tocirculate throughout the courts of mainland Europe of Christopher Columbus'discovery of land in the western Atlantic. Columbus'return to Europe in the spring of 1493 sparked a diplomatic controversy betweenthe crowns ofPortugal and Castile as he claimed the newly discovered territories on behalf of his sponsors, the Castilian crown, much to theconsternation ofJoao II. Like Columbus, Joao believed that the Genoesenavigator had managed to discover a seaborne route to the spice marketsof the east, by sailing westwards. Barros records Joao's anger at his returnwith evidence which seemed to suggest that he had in fact discovered theroute to India. The king:... was very upset to see that the people who came with him [Columbus] did nothave black, kinky hair like those of Guinea, but rather resembling the colour ofhair which he was informed was like that of India over which he had labored sohard. 27 Joao contested Columbus'discoveries as an infringement upon territoriesthat the Portuguese had already claimed under the Treaty of Alcac;ovas, which had been signed between the crowns of Portugal and Castile in 1479. This had stipulated that Portuguese influence extended to any territories discovered'beyond'Guinea, but quite how far this'beyond'stretched was tested to its limits by Columbus'discoveries. Joao soughtpapal arbitration in his dispute with Castile. After extensive negotiationbetween the crowns and Pope Alexander VI a compromise was reachedin June 1494 under the terms of the Treaty of Tordesillas. Castile claimedthe territories discovered by Columbus, whilst the Portuguese crown wasensured exclusive rights to all navigational routes throughout Africa, theeastern Atlantic and all territories to the east. The final Treaty ofTordesillas stipulated that:... a boundary or straight line be determined and drawn north and south, frompole to pole, on the said ocean sea, from the Arctic to the Antarctic pole. Thisboundary or line shall be drawn straight, at a distance of three hundred and seventy leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands.28 All territory to the west ofthis line fell under the jurisdiction ofCastile. Allterritory to the east was allocated to Portugal. Subsequent maps, like the Cantino Planisphere produced in 15 2, dutifully inscribed the dividingline between the two crowns, not only in an attempt to demarcate the relative spheres of interest of Portugal and Castile, but also to establish ageographically agreed meridian from which to define the significance offurther discoveries. As a result of Columbus'discoveries and the outcome of the Treaty of Tordesillas, it became increasingly imperative for the Portuguese to pushon with their search for a navigable route to India before Castile could dispatch new voyages to further erode their claims to the east. The death of Joao in 1495 led to a brief delay in further seaborne initiatives, but in 1497 the new king, Manuel, ordered the Portuguese commander Vasco da Gama to embark on a voyage which was to capitalize on Dias'earliervoyage round the Cape of Good Hope by reaching India and establishingtrading relations with the spice markets of the region. Embarking in July, da Gama's fleet sailed out into the Atlantic and headed south. After rounding the Cape the fleet sailed up the coast of East Africa as far as Malindi, where they struck out across the Indian Ocean. By May 1498 da Gama'sships had landed in Calicut on the west coast of India, and the Portugueseimmediately began to negotiate trading agreements with the local ruler, the Samorin of Calicut. The tentativeness of da Gama's encounter withthe samorin and his court is emphasized in the bizarre array of gifts presented to the king:... twelve pieces of lambel [striped cloth], four scarlet hoods, six hats, fourstrings of coral, a case containing six wash - hand basins, a case of sugar, twocasks ofoil, and two ofhoney.29 The Muslim factors operating out ofCalicut inspected the motley offeringand poured scorn on the Portuguese gifts: They came, and when they saw the present they laughed at it, saying it was not athing to offer to a king, that the poorest merchant from Mecca, or from any otherpart of India, gave more, and that ifhe wanted to make a present it should be ingold, as the king would not accept such things. 3 Not surprisingly, the samorin was suitably unimpressed by the gifts, andafter tense negotiations the Portuguese engaged in limited bartering withlocal merchants. By August, as relations with the samorin deteriorated, da Gama set sail on the return journey. In September 1499 he arrived back in Lisbon with a small but precious cargo of cinnamon, cloves, ginger, nutmeg and pepper, as well as a variety of woods and precious stones, enough to cover the expenses of the voyage six times over. The news ofda Gama's successful expedition was received with as muchexcitement as that accorded to Columbus. Its reverberations were quicklyfelt throughout mainland Europe as well as on the Iberian peninsula. Da Gama had opened the way, albeit tentatively, for Portuguese participationin the potentially lucrative trade ofthe Indian Ocean. King Manuel immediately wrote to the Castilian crown, triumphantly announcing the impactwhich da Gama's voyage would have on the commerce of early modern Europe: Moreover, we hope, with the help of God, that the great trade which now enriches the Moors of those parts, through whose hands it passes without theintervention ofother persons or people, shall, in consequence ofour regulationsbe diverted to the nations and ships of our own kingdom, so henceforth all Christendom, in this part ofEurope, shall be able, in a large measure, to provideitself with these spices and precious stones.3I Manuel's rhetoric of Christian unity and expansion in the face of thepower of Islam neatly forestalled any potential Castilian objections to Portugal's claim to these newly established trade routes via the Cape of Good Hope. However, the Venetian state was not as easily appeased as Castile, and in 1500 an alarmed Venetian seigniory dispatched a diplomatic delegation to Lisbon, led by Pietro Pasqualigo. At the level of formal exchanges the Venetians conceded the commercial and political significance of the Portuguese achievements. In his diplomatic address delivered to Manuel, Pasqualigo announced in his discussion of the newly established traderoute: What is greatest and most memorable of all, you have brought together underyour command peoples whom nature divides, and with your commerce youhave joined two different worlds. 32 With a similar rhetorical flourish Pasqualigo went on to claim: It should be understood how much benefit and utility the whole world gainsfrom the cane sugar and the many other products which are then transportedin great abundance in all directions for the use of mankind, and how mucheven posterity will benefit from the spices of every sort recently found by yourships.33 However, behind the scenes the Venetians desperately tried to sabotage Portugal's increasingly assertive participation in the spice trade. Accordingto Barros, Pasqualigo's entourage even infiltrated a diplomatic delegationfrom Indian states trading in spices, who had arrived in Lisbon to discuss Portugal's growing interest in the trade. The Venetians tried to argue thatthe Indians would benefit more by dealing directly with Venice rather than Portuga1.34 The fears of the Venetian delegation were well founded, andwere echoed in the gloomy predictions made by prominent merchants in Venice on hearing the news ofPortugal's arrival in India. Girolamo Priuli, a merchant and diarist, gloomily recorded in his diary in 1502: Therefore, now that this new route has been found by Portugal this King ofPortugal will bring all the spices to Lisbon and there is no doubt that the Hungarians, the Flemish and the French, and all the people from across themountains who once came to Venice to buy spices with their money will nowturn to Lisbon because it is nearer to their countries and easier to reach; alsobecause they will be able to buy at a cheaper price, which is most important ofall. This is because the spices that come to Venice pass through all of Syria, andthrough the entire country ofthe Sultan and everywhere they pay the most burdensome duties. Like wise, in the state of Venice they pay insupportable duties, customs, and excises. Thus with all the duties, customs, and excises between thecountry ofthe Sultan and the city ofVenice I might say that a thing that cost oneducat multiplies to sixty and perhaps to a hundred.35 In terms strikingly similar to the notes made by Behaim on his terrestrialglobe, Priuli quickly grasped the significance of the establishment of adirect seaborne trade route with India which circumvented the need topay the expensive customs duties for which the Venetian merchantsfound themselves liable. He pessimistically concluded that:... ifthis voyage from Lisbon to Calicut continues as it has begun, there will be ashortage of spices for the Venetian galleys, and their merchants will be like ababy without milk and nourishment. And in this, I clearly see the ruin of thecity ofVenice.36 As successive Portuguese voyages to India strengthened Manuel's grip onthe importation of spices into mainland Europe, Priuli's predictions apto be only too accurate, a situation which led to anpeared at firstintensification of the diplomatic conflict between Portugal and Venice. Underlining the illusion ofChristendom uniting in the face ofthe growingpower of the Islamic Ottoman empire, Venice urged both the Ottomansultan Bayezid II and the Egyptian Mamluk sultans to unite in a threepronged diplomatic and, if necessary, military defence of their commontrading interests. In 1503 Venice signed a peace agreement with the Ottomans in an attemptto stabilize trading relations in the eastern Mediterranean. By 1511 the Venetian seigniory had dispatched diplomaticdelegations to both Istanbul and Cairo in an attempt to encourage militaryactions against the commercial incursions of the Portuguese in India. interests. In 151 I Nor did the Portuguese fly the unblemished flag ofcrusading Christianity regardless of their own commercialthe navalcommander Alfonso d'Albuquerque negotiated with the Persian ruler Shah Ismail to launch a joint military attack on Egypt in an attempt tosecure strategic points in the Red Sea, which would ensure Portugal's expanding commercial development and divest Venice of one of its mostlucrative trade routes to the east.37 Whilst the plan ultimately failed to materialize, it was symptomatic of the extent to which the Portuguesediscovery of the seaborne route to the markets of the Indian Oceanbrought a whole new dimension to the commercial, diplomatic and geographical shape of the early modern world. Portugal's emergence as one ofthe most powerful empires in early sixteenth - century Europe was coterminous with its emergence as a key player in the commercial and politicalworld ofthe Indian Ocean and Southeast Asia. The political suspicion andcommercial jealousy directed towards the Portuguese, not only by Venicebut also by the crowns of France and England, was symptomatic of theanxiety produced by Portugal's ability to generate its conspicuous wealthand power from a strategic network of commercial and political locationswhich were far beyond the reach of mainland Europe, and which werebuilt, very literally, on water. This remarkable dispersion and diversification of long - distance travel, commercial exchange and diplomatic negotiation produced by the consequences of Portugal's establishment of the Cape route to India requiredlogistical and imaginative apparatuses to make sense of such changes. Maps, charts and globes such as the Cantino Planisphere and Behaim'sterrestrial globe disseminated vital conceptual information on the changing territorial and commercial shape of the world they depicted. Supplemented by the mass of travel narratives and diplomatic reportswhich emerged as a result of the Portuguese activities, such geographicalartefacts became prized possessions, not only keeping their owners informed of the latest discoveries and commercial ventures, but alsoproviding them with a sense of security as to their own identity withinsuch an ever - changing world. To be aware of the changing nature of theworld was to be able to position oneself confidently in relation to thatworld, even if the news that came from it may not always have been welcome. In August 1501, at the beginning of the diplomatic conflict between Venice and Portugal, Angelo Trevisan, secretary to the Venetian ambassador in Spain, wrote to the Venetian annalist Domenico Malipiero from Granada, announcing that: We are daily expecting our doctor from Lisbon, who left our magnificent ambassador there; who at my request has written a short account of the voyagefrom Calicut, ofwhich I will make a copy for Your Magnificence. It is impossibleto procure the map ofthat voyage because the king has placed a death penalty onanyone who gives it out.38 However, by the end of September Trevisan wrote again, informing Malipiero that: Ifwe return to Venice alive, Your Magnificence will see maps both as far as Calicut and beyond there less than twice the distance from here to Flanders. I promise you that everything has come in good order; but this, Your Magnificence may not care to divulge. One thing is certain, that you will learn uponour arrival as many particulars as though you had been at Calicut and farther. 39 It is not clear which map Trevisan obtained for Malipiero, but it presumably drew on the appearance of contemporaneous maps like the Cantino Planisphere, or the subsequent world chart attributed to Nicolaus de Caverio (illus. 25), which in its extensive depiction of the African coastlineand extensive legends on the trade at Calicut and Cochin reflected detailedawareness of the most recent Portuguese voyages. The desire for preciseinformation on the Portuguese activities, whatever their implications, created a new climate for the traffic in maps and charts as valuable materialobjects. In a diplomatic context, where the failure to obtain accurate information on the activities of a rival crown in distant places spelt potentialpolitical and commercial disaster, the strategic retention or dispersal ofgeographical information took on added significance. By 1510 such information was being offered for distribution on the open market. The Lisbon - based German printer Valentim Fernandes, who was responsiblefor printing the Report6rio dos Tempos in 1518, wrote to his colleague Steffan Gabler in 1510: I want to send you the coast from India to Malacca and the map with the islands, because so far all the pilots are still busy in the king's house; but afterwards theyare also at my disposition. 4 As with the Cantino Planisphere, it becomes clear that the latest geographical information contained in the maritime charts of the Portuguesewas available to the merchants and diplomats of mainland Europe. However, like the spices and pepper which began to appear in the marts ofnorthern Europe, this was at a price fixed within an intellectual market - place that was often as competitive as the marts which bought and sold theprecious spices from India. The'Continuous Travailes'ofPortuguese Cartography Ifone ofthe reasons why the merchants and diplomats ofthe early modernworld valued the maps and charts of the early Portuguese discoveries wasfor their ability to map and subsequently expand the margins of theknown world, it is ironic but significant that this very process should cometo constitute one ofthe central reasons for the intensified social and culturalambivalence accorded to the Portuguese over subsequent centuries. It is inthe nature of elite travellers like merchants and diplomats to explore andexplain the margins of their world picture. For merchants in particular, and commercially minded monarchs like Dom Henrique, a gap on theedge of the map could invariably constitute a gap in the commercialmarket. However, such investigations ofthe cultural and geographical margins has historically always evoked fear and suspicion in many people. It isthis ambivalence which is central to repeated accounts ofthe Portuguese asexorbitant voyagers, heroically sailing beyond the limits of their own culture but risking exposure to any number of dangerous and debilitatingsituations, from death and disease to more mysterious and intangible dangers associated with figures who leave their own culture and subsequentlyreturn from places unknown to the majority ofthe population. Throughoutthe period writers warned of the dangers of travel to unknown territories, and the potentially damaging effect it could have on the traveller. Yet mapsand charts were problematically positioned in relation to this ambivalentresponse. Whilst maps and charts may assist the armchair geographer inavoiding the need to travel, such geographical information must inevitablyemerge from direct encounters and transactions with distant places andpeople. One convenient solution to this paradox was to elide the contextsof the production ofsuch maps. In the Preface to his world map publishedin 1506, the Venetian cartographer Giovanni Contarini announced boldly: The world and all its seas on a flat map... Lo! Giovanni Matteo Contarini, Famed in the Ptolemaean art, has compiled and marked it out. Whither away? Stay, traveller, and behold new nations and a new - found world. 41 Self - consciously selling his new map on the basis of its ability to insulateits buyer from the potentially dangerous effects of long - distance travel, Contarini's comment neatly sidesteps the fact that it was produced fromthe maritime charts of the early Portuguese voyages along the Africancoast and into the Indian Ocean. By 1559 the English geographer William 25 Nicolaus de Caverio, world chart, c. 1505, vellum. Bibliotheque Nationale de France, Paris (Charts and Plans). Cunningham could write of his experience of drawing up maps that: I may in like sorte at my pleasure, drawe a Carde for Spaine, Fraunce, Germany, Italye, Graece, or any perticuler region: yea, in a warme & pleasant house, without any perill of the raging Seas: danger of enemies: losse of time: spending ofsubstaunce: weriness of body, or anguishe of minde. 0 how precious a Jewell isthis, it may rightly be called a Cosmographicall Glasse, in which we may beholdethe diversitie ofcountries: natures of people, & innumerable formes ofBeastes, Foules, Fishes, Trees, Frutes, Stremes, & Meatalles. 42 For Cunningham, the advantages of such maps and charts was that they'delivereth us from greate and continuall travailes', exemplifying a contemporary conflation of the idea of travel as inevitably involving painfulexertion and personal suffering. If his position became one of the sellingpoints of lavishly printed sixteenth - century maps and atlases, then it wasin part as a result of the practical advances made by Portuguese pilots, merchants and sailors as they inched their way along the coast of Africaand carefully pinpointed their journeys onwards towards India. The Portuguese did not have the luxury of taking up such a position, and in manyways were subsequently judged for their inability to retain a level of cultural'distance'from the communities with which they interacted. Theirsustained encounters and transactions with peoples and cultures perceivedas either barbarous or antithetical to the principles of European civilitymarked them as outsiders within the conception of Europe itself, dangerous voyagers who persistently exposed themselves to the deracinatingeffects of long - distance travel. Whilst the markets of mainland Europe may have been eager to consume the precious merchandise loaded by the Portuguese ships in Guinea, Calicut, Goa and Malacca, its scholars were more circumspect intheir acceptance of knowledges gleaned from communities which itdeemed inimical to the values of European culture. Yet the Portuguesewere to stretch the intellectual and geographical limits ofEuropean knowledge in their voyages and explorations, leading them to encounters andtransactions with peoples and cultures who, as in the case of da Gama'slanding in India, regarded their learning and aspirations as at best incomthe pragmaticprehensible and at worst highly inadequate. However, Portuguese persistently assimilated the alien knowledges which they encountered and fed them straight into the maps and charts which theygradually built up as they sailed further into unknown waters. In 1498, as Vasco da Gama sailed up the east coast of Africa, he quickly realized howinadequate his maps and navigational instruments were in attempting tocross the Indian Ocean to reach India. Whilst stopping in Malindi in 1498, his crew employed a Muslim navigator. In the written account ofthe voyage, the narrator explains that whilst in Malindi:... there came a Moor, a Gujerati named Malemo Canawho, as much because ofthe pleasure which he had from conversation with us, as in order to please the King [of Malindi] who was seeking a navigator for him [da Gama], agreed togo with him. Vasco da Gama, after he had had a discussion with him, was greatlysatisfied with his knowledge: principally, when he [the Moor] showed him achart of the whole of the coast of India drawn, in the fashion of the Moors, thatis with meridians and parallels, very close together but without any windrhumbs. Because the square network of these meridians and parallels was verysmall, the coast within those from North to South and from East to West wasvery accurate, without that multiplication of wind rhumbs drawn from a singlecompass - rose of our charts, which serves as the origin of the other directions. And when Vasco da Gama showed him a large astrolabe of wood which he hadwith him, and others of metal with which he measured the altitude of the sun, the Moor expressed no surprise, saying that some navigators ofthe Red Sea usedbrass instruments of triangular shape and quadrants with which they measuredthe altitude ofthe sun and, principally ofthe star [the Pole Star] which they mostcommonly used in navigation. 43 Cana offered da Gama hydrographical information which utilized a muchmore sophisticated knowledge of astronomical observation than had beendeveloped even in Portugal. Eschewing the techniques practised in the Mediterranean of navigating according to the compass and wind direction, Cana's charts and knowledge of navigationalinstruments werecrucial to the successful navigation from Malindito Calicut, and da Gama clearly had no scruples in utilizing a Muslim pilot in the pursuit ofhis mission. In the triumphant letter which King Manuel sent to the Castilian crown in the aftermath of da Gama's voyage, the Portuguesesovereign displayed little reticence in celebrating the local navigationalknowledges which da Gama appropriated whilst on his voyage:... they captured a ship of the King ofCalicut, from which they have brought tome some jewels of great price, 1500 pearls, amounting to 8000 ducats, threeastrological instruments of silver, not in use amongst our astrologers. They arelarge and well made, and have been extremely useful to me. They say that the King of Calicut had sent the aforementioned ship to an island called Saponinto obtain these instruments and to get a good pilot and a navigation chart forthose lands. Now the pilot is in our hands, and I am having our languagetaught to him since he shows an understanding of these astrological instruments. 44 The information gleaned from local pilots and cosmographers appears tohave been rapidly assimilated into the early Portuguese charts of the seasand territories to the east of the Cape. Whilst negotiating with the Persian Shah Ismail in ISII, Alfonso d'Albuquerque obtained a detailed chart depicting the Cape of Good Hope, the Red Sea, the Indian Ocean and the Moluccas. It was constructed by a Javan pilot, and the place names werewritten in Javan. A portion of the chart was forwarded to Manuel by thepilot, Francisco Rodrigues, who appended a legend to the map, announcIng: Your Highness can truly see where the Chinese and Gores come from, and thecourse your ships must take to the Clove Islands, and where the gold mines lie, and the islands ofJava and Banda, of nutmeg and maces, and the land of the King of Siam, and also the end of the navigation of the Chinese, the directionit takes, and how they do not navigate further. 45 Rodrigues had sailed to Malacca with d'Albuquerque in 1511 and wentunder the grand title of'Pilot - major of the first armada that discovered Banda and the Moluccas'. He was reputed to be aJavan seconded by d'AI buquerque whilst on his travels, and in 1513 he produced a manuscriptbook of roteiros, or maritime charts, supplemented with written navigational descriptions of coasts. These were amongst the first charts ofsouthern and eastern Africa to calculate the latitudes of the region (illus. 26), presumably by using the types of astronomical instruments Canahad told da Gama about. Maps like the Cantino Planisphere and theworld chart of Caverio both show evidence of their absorption of localknowledges in their calculation of latitude and depiction of territory. 4 Both are indicative of the extent to which the maps and charts whichemerged from these Portuguese voyages were not the pristine and triumphant cultural trophies of Renaissance exploration, but hybrid culturalartefacts fashioned from the exchange of knowledge and information between the Portuguese and local interlocutors. The elaborately printedglobal geography produced in the print capitals of northern Europe, suchas Martin Waldseemuller's world map of 1507 (illus. 27), whilst drawingextensively on the Portuguese voyages and their hybrid maps and charts, expunged all reference to the ways in which their production was informedby the'alien intelligence'gleaned from local pilots and geographers. Whilst Waldseemuller's map attempted to incorporate the Castilian discoveries inthe Americas to the west, it is clear that it is the territories to the south andeast, namely Africa and Asia, which still held the main focus of geographical attention. It was magnificently printed maps like Waldseemuller's thatcaptured the attention of the map - buying elite of early modern Europe, rather than the scarce and precious manuscript maps and charts producedby Portuguese pilots and geographers. As a result, such maps carefullyoccluded the alien knowledges assimilated into the original Portuguesecharts, offering their owners a sanitized vision of geographical and commercial expansion, bereft of the troublingly unfamiliar encounters whichthe Portuguese experienced on their long - distance voyages. The fact that the Portuguese built their extensive commercial empire 26 Francisco Rodrigues, chart of southern Africa, c. 1513. Bibliotheque de la O1ambre des Deputes, Paris. literally on water only fuelled suspicions as to their political power and cultural authority. Of all forms of long - distance travel none was perceivedwith more fear and awe than travelling by sea. Voyaging across unknownoceans to relatively unknown lands only reinforced people's suspicions asto where the Portuguese had gone, and from where they would return. Seaborne travel also brought with it practical difficulties which forestalledany possibility of establishing recognizably systematic regimes of colonialdomination for centuries to come. Transporting men and equipment bysea over long distances was a necessary evil, as it was invariably more commodious than travelling overland. However, it was a slow, laborious anddangerous undertaking. Unlike the relentless territorial expansion of the Castilian crown in the Americas, which concentrated on plunder and theextraction of tribute, the Portuguese empire was always much more reliantupon a far more transactional and commercial model ofdevelopment. As aresult, it had to come to terms with knowledges which it encounteredwhich could not be simply ignored or destroyed, as they were vital to thecommercial success of the Portuguese initiatives. The production of mapsand charts exemplified the transactional nature of the early Portuguesevoyages down the coast of Africa and onwards into the Indian Ocean. They became, in fact, the practical bedrock for all subsequent printedcartography over much of the globe for the next 200 years, however distasteful mainstream European reactions to the Portuguese intermingling 27 Martin WaldseemiiUer, world map, woodcut on 12 sheets of paper, Strassburg, 1507. Fiirstlich zu Waldburg Wolfegg'sche Kupferstichkabinett. of goods, people and knowledge became. Perhaps now, bereft of a perception of the Renaissance as a time of unrivalled European confidence in thepursuit of new worlds in the name of an unbounded curiosity, and in thelight of revisions within Portuguese historiography itselfas to the status ofthe'Great Discoveries',47 it is possible to reassess the importance of the Portuguese who, in their pursuit ofworldly wealth, were primarily responsible for defining the political and commercial contours of the earlymodern world. 3 Disorienting the East: The Geographyof the Ottoman Empire Plotting with the Enemy? In 1464 the Florentine scholar Francesco Berlinghieri began work on ageographical treatise based on Ptolemy's Geographia, updating its mapsand supplementing them with a running commentary composed inverse. Berlinghieri was an established figure in the humanist communitywhich had begun to emerge in late fifteenth - century Florence. After finding employment as an orator at the Este court in Mantua, he subsequentlyjoined the court of Lorenzo de'Medici and participated in the Platonic Academy established in Florence by Marsilio Ficino, under the patronageof Lorenzo. Berlinghieri was amongst the auditores of Ficino's lectureswhich extolled the values of classical Greek learning. I He also took part ina public disputation with Ficino on the intellectual significance of Ptolemy's Geographia. Berlinghieri was therefore uniquely situated atthecentre of humanist learning in late fifteenth - century Italy, a situation reflected in the publication of his geographical treatise based on Ptolemy'shighly influential geographical text. By the summer of 1482 the translationwas finally complete and ready to be printed, with maps, by the renowned German printer Nicolaus Laurentii, under the title Septe Giornate della Geographia di Francesco Berlinghieri. It is difficult to overestimate the significance of Berlinghieri's printedtreatise in the early history of cartography. Not only was it amongst thefirst texts based on Ptolemy's Geographia to be actually printed, but it wasalso the first work on Ptolemy to be translated into vernacular Italian. Perhaps even more importantly, Berlinghieri's text was one of the first tobreak with Ptolemaic tradition by supplementing the accepted runningorder of the maps in the Geographia with four'modern'regional maps of Italy, Spain, France and Palestine. 2 As a result it established a countertradition which involved the gradual incorporation of new maps and geographical information into subsequent printed collections of maps whichbased themselves on Ptolemy. Although the world map which adorned thefirst pages of the section of maps in Berlinghieri's Geographia remainedtied to the Ptolemaic conception of the oikoumene (illus. 28), its utilizationof the new techniques of print culture produced an image of remarkable 28 Francesco Berlinghieri, world map from his Geographia, copper engraving, Florence, 1482. British Library, London. visual clarity and geographical precision, which surpassed previous manuscript attempts to re - create the Ptolemaic oikoumene. Like Berlinghierihimself, the elegant and erudite text stood as a striking example of thenew humanist learning which was spreading across the city - states of latefifteenth - century Italy, as scholars, painters and architects turned to theclassical worlds of Greece and Rome for inspiration and instructionwithin the fields of science, education and the arts. However, all was notas it seemed, for Berlinghieri's innovative text was not, as one might haveexpected, dedicated to one of the many princely patrons throughout fifteenth - century Italy, such as Lorenzo de'Medici. Instead, Berlinghierichose to dedicate his treatise to none other than the Ottoman sultan Mehmed II, 'the Conqueror', the so - called'scourge of Christendom', whoin 1453 had captured the ancient capital of the Byzantine empire, Constantinople, from the disparate military forces of Christian Europe. Evenmore remarkable is the surviving record ofBerlinghieri's admiring dedication to Mehmed in the copy of the text which still exists in the Topkapi Saray Museum in Istanbul: To Mehmed of the Ottomans, illustrious prince and lord of the throne of God, emperor and merciful lord ofall Asia and Greece, I dedicate this work.3 Standard histories of the European Renaissance have invariably definedthe development of its love of learning and commitment to a civilizingprocess in direct opposition to the menacing threat ofthe Islamic Ottomanempire, persistently represented as a dark despotic threat looming over theforces ofenlightenment and disinterested intellectual enquiry which supposedly characterized late fifteenth - and early sixteenth - century Europe. Within this scenario, the Ottoman empire, and Mehmed in particular, came to represent the direct antithesis of everything for which the European Renaissance stood. However, if this was indeed the case, then howdid such an intellectually and politically respected figure as Berlinghiericome to dedicate one of the most innovative geographical texts of the Italian Renaissance to one of its most apparently demonized figures? This chapter seeks to provide an answer to this question by rejectingaccounts of the Renaissance which continue to demonize and occlude theplace of the Ottoman empire within the social and cultural dynamics ofthe early modem period. To place the Ottomans beyond the remit of thedevelopment ofearly modem Europe is to emplot a much later geopolitical shift upon an earlier historical moment, a shift which fixed theboundary between western Europe and the Ottoman territories at a pointof military disengagement at the beginning of the eighteenth century.4 The concern ofthis chapter is to examine what the cultural and geographical landscape of early modem Europe looked like prior to the impositionof these frontiers between East and West, and to what extent the Ottomanempire was constitutive of, rather than antagonistic to, the formation ofthe cultural and geographical map of late fifteenth - and early sixteenthcentury Europe. The following pages therefore attempt to reorient an understanding of early modem Europe and its boundaries which places the Ottomans as central, rather than peripheral, to the political and intellectual preoccupations of the period. By the middle of the sixteenth century, the Ottoman empire was one ofthe most powerful empires in the early modern world. Its bordersstretched for over 10,000 kilometres, encompassing huge swathes of territory from Hungary to the steppes of Central Asia, and it outstripped therealms under the control of any comparable European monarch. 5 Its origins emanated from a small Anatolian province located between Byzantium and the Seljuk Turks, which grew throughout the fourteenthcentury until, by the fifteenth century, the rapidly growing Muslimforces of the Ottomans threatened the seat of the Holy Roman Empireitself, Constantinople. In 1453 Constantinople (hereafter referred to as Istanbul) finally fell to Mehmed's forces. Standard western critical responsesto the fall of the city have characterized the event as one of the most disastrous calamities to befall Christian Europe in the fifteenth century, inspiring fear and dread in the hearts of Christians throughout Europethat the crescent flag of Islam would ultimately overrun the length andbreadth of mainland Europe.6 However, the capture of the city by the Ottomans and their subsequent annexation of the territories of theformer Byzantine empire left the scholars, merchants and diplomats offifteenth - century Italy exhibiting far more ambivalent responses to therise of Ottoman power than has often been believed. Within just one yearof the fall of the Byzantine capital, the Venetian authorities had signed apeace treaty with the Ottoman authorities that allowed them to continuetrading in regions previously under the control of the Byzantine empire, which now came under Ottoman jurisdiction. Scholars of the periodwere also far more circumspect in their responses to the impact of the Ottoman presence in Istanbul. The territories which increasingly cameunder the control of the Ottomans were precisely those areas from whichearly Italian humanists like Ficino and Berlinghieri had drawn their intellectual and imaginative sustenance in their recovery of the learning ofclassical antiquity. Stories abound of the desperate transmission of precious Greek and Roman manuscripts between the Byzantine city andmainland Italy prior to the fall of the city. However, scholars appear tohave been more concerned that, rather than rejecting the importance ofclassicalthe Ottomans were actually appropriating classical Graeco - Roman models of learning for their own political ends. In 1466 learning, the Greek scholar George Trepuzuntios wrote to Mehmed the Conquerorinforming him that: No one doubts that you are emperor of the Romans. Whoever holds by right thecenter of the Empire is emperor and the center of the Empire is Constantinople.7 Another Greek scholar, Kritovoulos of Imbros, described Mehmed'sachievements as being'in no way inferior to those ofAlexander the Macedonian'.8 In 1481 the Venetian painter and medallist Costanzo da Ferraraarrived in Istanbul at the request of Mehmed, and cast a portrait medal ofthe Ottoman sultan (illus. 29) which drew extensively on Roman imperialprototypes, a fact which was presumably not lost on the astute Mehmed. In terms of the newly acquired geographical position of the seat of Ottoman power, Mehmed's reign sought to cultivate political and culturalcomparisons and analogies between the Graeco - Roman classical traditionand the successes of the Ottoman empire, rather than establishing an attitude of hostility or incomprehension towards such a tradition, whichwould only have been counterproductive in making Mehmed's cultural, and hence political, power intelligible to his Italian political counterparts. Such comparisons were also not lost on the rival city - states of Italy as theyjockeyed for authority towards the end of the fifteenth century. The Ottomans appeared to many as highly desirable political allies in the delicatebalance of power within the eastern Mediterranean. In 1461 Sigismondo Malatesta, Lord of Rimini, sent the painter, architect and medallist Matteo de'Pasti to the Ottoman court, with a letter praising Mehmed'smilitary exploits and, like Kritovoulos, comparing his deeds to those of Alexander the Great.9 Malatesta's reasons for courting the sultan so assiduously seem to have been based on his search for a political ally in hiscontinuing rivalry with Venice. The Ottomans did not therefore cut offpolitical and cultural connections with the Graeco - Roman world whichmainland Europe had been cultivating throughout the fifteenth century; they simply appropriated them as a way of strengthening their ownclaims to imperial authority throughout the territories of the classicalworld. It was this fact which concerned the scholars and diplomats ofearly modem Europe. Whilst the public diplomatic rhetoric of the periodcondemned the expansion of the Ottomans and called for a united Christian front against the growth of a powerful Muslim empire, behind thescenes city - states like Venice, Rimini and Florence fought for politicaland commercial concessions from the ascendant Ottoman empire. Similarly, scholars like Ficino and Berlinghieri were keen to retain linkswith Istanbul as one ofthe remaining centres oflearning which establisheda connection between the classical world ofancient Rome and Greece and 29 Costanzo da Ferrara, Sultan Mehmed II (obverse), The Sultan Riding (reverse), c. 1481, bronze portrait medal. National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC. the contemporary world of the fifteenth century. As the Ottomans controlled a significant area of the oikoumene portrayed in Ptolemy's Geographia, they were also in possession of not only the majority of themost lucrative overland trade routes between Asia and mainland Europe, but also most of the ancient centres of learning which were celebrated byfifteenth - century Italian humanism, such as Baghdad, Alexandria and Cairo. As with the Graeco - Roman world, this did not involve Ottomanimperial ignorance or dismissal of the intellectual traditions representedby these centres of learning, but an appropriation of such traditions fortheir own ends. As the Ottomans were so centrally involved in both thediplomatic and intellectual worlds of late fifteenth - and early sixteenthcentury Europe, it is telling that a prominent scholar like Berlinghierishould choose to dedicate such a significant geographical text as his Geographia to an illustrious patron of the calibre of the Ottoman sultan Mehmed II. Quite how central the Ottomans were in the diplomatic andintellectual controversy which surrounded the production of Berlinghieri's treatise becomes clear if we take a closer look at its fascinatinghistory. Berlinghieri's text stands in its own right as a fine example of the practical and intellectual issues which emerged around the new technology ofprinting. Berlinghieri's Geographia was over thirteen years in the making, as the Florentine scholar collated the works of Ptolemy as well as supplementing them with more contemporary maps and geographical treatises. As he calculated that the text would include thirty - one maps (more thanany other printed text then available), it was decided that the illustrationsshould be engraved on copper plates before being printed. This was an expensive and highly sophisticated printing technique which allowed forhigher technical definition in illustrations than that produced using wood - cuts. However, as there were few established copper - engravers skilled inthe art of cartography, Berlinghieri had to wait longer than usual for thecompletion of his maps. As initial copies of his text slowly emerged fromthe printing house, Berlinghieri took the initiative ofascribing manuscriptdedications in the front of selected printed copies. One such copy contained the manuscript dedication to Mehmed II. In this copy of his Geographia Berlinghieri inserted a letter dedicating the text to the newsultan, Bayezid II. In the letter he explained that he had intended to dedicate his Geographia to Bayezid's father, Mehmed, but that when the newsreached Florence that Mehmed had died in May 1481 he had been leftwithout a figure ofsuitable stature to whom he could dedicate his text. Asa result, he had hastily decided to dedicate it to the Duke ofUrbino, Federigo da Montefeltro, whose successful career as a mercenary soldier wasmatched by his enthusiastic patronage of scholarship and the arts. IO By 1482 Federigo's library contained over a thousand manuscripts, whilstcontemporary paintings depicted him as a master of both the pen andthe sword (illus. 30). Berlinghieri described the duke in appropriatelyglowing terms, lauding him as being'supreme in military virtue andwisdom'. Unfortunately for the luckless Berlinghieri, by the time the corrected type for the edition had been finally completed Federigo had alsodied, in September 1482. Berlinghieri explained that he was therefore returning to his initial attempt to dedicate the text to an Ottoman sultan, andwas dedicating it to Bayezid II in the light of the deaths of both Mehmedand Federigo. Whilst not as enthusiastic a patron of the arts as his father, Bayezid oversaw a range of intellectual and cultural transactions between Istanbul and the Italian city - states which had been encouraged by hisincluding negotiations in 1492 with Francesco Gonzaga II offather, Mantua, who wished to buy Arab horses from the sultan. I I Bayezid alsoestablished a reputation amongst the Florentine merchants based in Istanbul as a respected sovereign with whom they could do business. In 15 2 the Florentine merchant Giovanni di Francesco Maringhi wrote to colleaguesin Florence from Istanbul claiming that Bayezid:... has shown so great an interest in us... [and] in all ofour business; and sincehe also displays a cordial fondness for all our nation. Before I close this, I will tellyou the kindness he has done, and is still constantly doing with respect to thedead and the bankrupt merchants; so that one is able to see that he desires thatwe be held in esteem throughout all his realm. May God send his blessing. 12 News of the esteem in which Bayezid was held by the Florentine community since his assumption of royal power in 1481 can have onlystrengthened Berlinghieri's resolve to dedicate his text to the new Ottomansultan. The fact that Berlinghieri repeatedly attempted to dedicate the 30 Pedro Berruguete, Federigo da Montele/tro IlJith his son Guidoba/do, 1477, oil on canvas. Palazzo Ducale, Urbino. Geographia to an Ottoman sultan, over and above potential Italian patronslike the Medici family, is powerful testimony to the political weight andcultural authority which emanated from the Ottoman court, an authoritywhich was felt even amongst the scholars offifteenth - century Florence. However, the connection between Berlinghieri's Geographia and the Ottoman court did not end there. Mehmed's death in 1481 sparked avicious struggle for political succession between his sons Bayezid and Cern. After being defeated in battle in 1482, Cern fled to Europe where hemoved from court to court seeking support for an anti - Bayezid coalition toattack Istanbul and install himself as sultan. Despite the interest of severalleading princes and monarchs, nobody was prepared to risk the level ofmilitary and financial expenditure required to realistically take on themight of Bayezid's armies. Eager to keep his brother out of the Ottomandominions, Bayezid bought off the Christian Knights Hospitallers of Rhodes and Pope Innocent VIII himself with precious relics from hisfather's extensive collection, in an attempt to ensure that Cern remained avirtual hostage in Europe.'3 However, in the summer of 1484 Paolo da Colle, an agent working on behalf of Lorenzo de'Medici, and who hadtaken Berlinghieri's Geographia to Istanbul in 1482 for presentation to Bayezid, was dispatched to Savoy, where Cern was living. Da Colle hadbeen sent to Cern by Berlinghieri, and carried with him a copy of Berlinghieri's Geographia. The text which he delivered to Cern was identical tothe text he had presented to Bayezid eighteen months earlier, down tothe dedicatory letters written by Berlinghieri in both copies. The onlychange was a hastily added dedicatory preface in manuscript addressed to Cern, extolling his princely attributes in almost exactly the same terms asthose addressed to Bayezid and Federigo.14 Berlinghieri's gift was little help to Cern in his attempt to wrest powerfrom his brother. In 1495, whilst gathering a military force to attack Bayezid, he died mysteriously. Many believe he was poisoned by thosesympathetic to Bayezid. Nevertheless, Berlinghieri's repeated attempts toassociate his Geographia with Mehmed and with his two sons as theystruggled for control of the Ottoman crown is symptomatic of the extentto which geography played a central role in the diplomatic manoeuvringsof the period, as the key protagonists in the struggle for the regions depicted in his maps circulated on paper the territories which they soughtto possess by strength of arms. As such, Berlinghieri's dedicatory strategies were also a highly skilful marketing strategy to establish his Geographia as the primary geographical text through which the centralprotagonists in the diplomatic drama of the period came to imagine theterritories across which they moved. In technical terms, Berlinghieri's text did not completely live up to expectations. In trying to come to grips with the new techniques of printingfrom copper - engraving the maps were littered with misspelt names andhastily corrected misattributions. In the ninth map of the atlas entitled Tabula Sexta De Uropa depicting territories between mainland Europeand the Ottoman dominions, the word'Uropa'of the title is run into theword'Asia' (illus. 31). This striking error in the composition ofthe printedtext is an example of the often contradictory procedures by which the institution of printed geography attempted to define the boundaries ofearlymodern Europe. Whilst the mistake is symptomatic of the difficultieswhich the geographer and printer experienced in their attempts to utilizethe new technology of print (it is noticeable that a similar mistake is alsomade in the sixth map of Europe), it is also a significant comment on thededicatory vicissitudes and diplomatic manoeuvrings which framed theproduction of Berlinghieri's text. 15 At the historical point at which theboundary between Europe and Asia was itself in flux as a result of therapid expansion of the Ottoman empire, the maps in the Geographia exhibit a level of uncertainty as to where contemporary geographers drew the 31 Francesco Berlinghieri, 'Tabula Sexta De Uropa', Geographia, copper engraving, Florence, 1482. British Library, London. dividing line between'Europe'and its eastern frontiers, which were underconstant revision in the face ofOttoman territorial expansion. The princesand diplomats of the period consulted their personal maps in order toascertain the status of their dominions as a result of territories tradedbetween empires and states. The ease with which Berlinghieri negotiatedthe status of his own text in relation to the diplomatic and intellectual exchanges between the territories of the Ottoman empire and mainland Italyemphasizes the extent to which no such geographical or imaginative line ofdemarcation firmly existed between a political East and West in the earlymodem world. Whilst derogatory post - Enlightenment discourses of Orientalism have firmly demarcated the notion of the East in the westernintellectual and political imagination as beginning somewhere around Istanbul, the geographical, diplomatic and intellectual exchanges acrossthis apparent divide throughout the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries underline the fact that no such distinction existed for Berlinghieriand his contemporaries. The Ottomans were politically and intellectuallypowerful participants in the early modem world, and their leaders were ascompliant and enthusiastic in the patronage of scholarship and artisticproduction as their Italian counterparts. Mehmed's Maps: Ottoman Patronage ojGeography It should be stressed that Berlinghieri's attempts to dedicate his Geographia to Mehmed and Bayezid were not based on diplomatic expediencyalone. In many ways even a scant knowledge of Mehmed's patronage ofart and science would have convinced him that the sultan was the logicalchoice as patron of a geographical text based on the work of Ptolemy. Critics of the transmission of classical Graeco - Roman texts between Constantinople and Italy prior to the fall of the Byzantine capital haveoften portrayed this movement of learning and ideas as a seamless process whereby the scholars of fifteenth - century Italy imbibed the texts ofthe ancient world by a process of intellectual osmosis. Such a transmission of ideas has been seen as the backbone to the establishment of theso - called civilization of Renaissance Europe. The scholars and bookhunters of the period did systematically track down ancient manuscriptsand methodically engage in the massive task of translating these textsfrom the original Greek into Latin for wider consumption. However, the status of Arabic learning and, even more noticeably, the role of the Ottomans in this process of cultural transmission have been playeddown in the process of asserting the predominance of an exclusively'western tradition', with all its geographical and intellectual connotationsof Christian, European authority and superiority. However, in manyareas scholars had to deal with classical texts which had survived as aresult of their cultivation by Arab scholars. From the ninth to the fourteenth centuries the most innovative scholarly activity within the fields ofastronomy and cosmography emanated from Arabic centres of learningin North Africa, Moorish Spain and the territories increasingly underthe control of the Ottomans. Many of the early Portuguese forays intothe fields of astronomy and navigation emerged directly from the complex inheritance of Islamic and Hebraic Iberian scholars. 16 Themanuscript texts of Ptolemy's astronomical and geographical works wereno exception to this process of intellectual transmission and circulation. Throughout the ninth and tenth centuries most of the classical works ofscience and mathematics had been translated into Arabic at the Academyof Science established in Baghdad in 813 by al - Ma'mun, the Caliph of Baghdad.17 The academy was particularly active in the field of astronomyas well as the attempt to calculate the precise length of a degree in thewake of Ptolemy's studies. Arab scholars such as al - Ma'mun not onlypreserved classical scholarly texts, but in many instances built on suchknowledges to develop new scientific theories. Texts included not only Ptolemy's Geographia but also his astronomical treatise the Almagest, which was translated into Latin from Arabic for the first time in 1175 by Gerard of Cremona, whose translation formed the basis of the firstprinted edition of the text in Europe in 1515.18 As for the Geographia, itwas subsequently transcribed into Syriac, and formed the basis for mostof the geographical and cosmographical research which proceeded toemerge from al - Ma'mun's academy.19 Nor was the emergence of Ptolemaic texts limited to their circulationwithin Baghdad. There remain thirteen known works produced in Arabicin manuscript prior to the twelfth century, including three copies of the Geographia. 20 However, historians of cartography still insist on elidingthis aspect of the transmission of Ptolemy, in favour of stressing a neatlinear movement of the text from Byzantium to Italy. Such a view disregards the extent to which the territorial growth of the Ottoman empirethroughout the fifteenth century gradually assimilated ancient centres of Arabic learning into its imperial structure. In 1471 the renowned astronomer cAlI Q!IshjI, the head of the observatory in Samarkand, moved to Istanbul to continue his studies under the generous financial benefactionof Mehmed. The substantial library which he took with him (and whichundoubtedly included copies of Ptolemy's work) transformed the field of Ottoman cosmography.21 With cAlI Q!IshjI came a whole host of scholarsas well as artists and architects, drawn to Istanbul as Mehmed sought toredefine the city as an Islamic Constantinople, a cultural capital fit to rivalthe great civic centres of fifteenth - century Italy. Throughout the 1470S and 1480s Italian artists and craftsmen of the stature of Gentile Bellini, Constanzo de Ferrara, Matteo de'Pasti and the architect Filarete were allreported to have played an active part in culturally restructuring the Ottoman capita1.22 Istanbul became a major centre for intellectual and artisticproduction, which was enthusiastically supported by a sultan keen toemphasize that his cosmopolitan capital was at the centre, rather than onthe periphery, of a whole range of artistic and scholarly traditions andinitiatives. Nowhere was this situation more vividly illustrated than in Mehmed's patronage of geographical research. Scholars such as cAlI QushjI provided a vigorous intellectual context for the study of cosmography and geography, and one particularly striking instance of Mehmed'ssubsequent interest in this area underlines Berlinghieri's desire to dedicatehis Geographia to the Ottoman sultan. One of the most respected scholars amongst Mehmed's retinue was the Greek chronicler Kritovoulos of1mbros. In his manuscript The History of Mehmed the Conqueror, written in honour of the Ottoman sultan's achievements, Kritovoulos claimed that: His highness the Sultan used to read philosophical works translated into the Arabic from Persian and Greek, and discuss the subjects of which they treatedwith the scholars of his court. Having read the works of the renowned geographer Ptolemy and perused the diagrams which explained these studiesscientifically, the Sultan found these maps to be in disarray and difficult to construe. Therefore he charged the philosopher Amirutzes with the task ofdrawinga new clearer and more comprehensible map. Amirutzes accepted with pleasure, and worked with meticulous care. After spending the summer months in studyand research, he arranged the sections in scientific order. He marked the rivers, islands, mountains, cities and other features. He laid down rules for distanceand scale, and having completed his studies he presented the Sultan and thoseengaged in scholarship and science with a work of great benefit. Amirutzeswrote the names of the regions and cities in the Arabic script, and for this purpose engaged the help of his son, who was master of both Arabic and Greek.23 Georgius Amirutzes worked on his new version ofPtolemy throughout thesummer of 1465, and appears to have been helped in his new commissionby George Trepuzuntios, another scholarly admirer of Mehmed. Trepuzuntios had returned to Istanbul from Italy in the same year to discusswith Amirutzes his new Greek translation of Ptolemy's astronomicaltreatise the Almagest, a text which Trepuzuntios proceeded to dedicate to Mehmed. In his History Kritovoulos went on to note that Mehmed subsequently'ordered him [Amirutzes] to issue the entire book in Arabic, andpromised him large pay and gifts for this work'.24 This remarkable commission was completed by Amirutzes towards the end of 1465, and asurviving manuscript version of the map offers testimony to the skill andlearning which clearly went into its production (illus. 32). Despite theinitial unfamiliarity of its appearance, with its Arabic nomenclature andsouth oriented to the top of the map, its detailed representation of the Ptolemaic oikoumene, along with its sophisticated conical projection complete with scales oflatitude, emphasizes that it was one of the most up - todate fifteenth - century representations of the globe based on Ptolemy'scalculations. It should therefore be stressed that the apparently alienappearance of the map can be ascribed to the systematic occlusion ofsuch traditions of Islamic mapping within histories of cartography, andnot to its novelty as an isolated example ofOttoman - sponsored geographysimply aping the conventions of Italian mapmaking. Mehmed's sponsorship ofAmirutzes'redrawing ofPtolemy's oikoumeneestablishes the fact that Ottoman scholars were able to draw on a body of Arabic scholarship when working on a text such as Ptolemy's Geographia, atext to which they had as much intellectual claim as the scholars offifteenth - century Italy. The recovery of shared classical texts was pursuedas vigorously in Istanbul as it was in Italian centres such as Florenceand Urbino. In fact, Kritovoulos'comments suggest that the Ottoman 32 Georgius Arnirutzes, world map, c. 1465, vellum. Ayasofya Library, Istanbul. scholars, and even Mehmed himself, had a more comprehensive range ofboth Greek and Arabic copies of Ptolemy to consult in the construction oftheir new editions, and that this range of intellectual reference allowed Ottoman geographical scholarship to develop along lines not dissimilar tothose developed in Italy around the same time. Figures such as Borsod'Este, the Duke of Ferrara, whose family was responsible for secretlyobtaining the Cantino Planisphere from Lisbon in 1502, financially supported the work of geographers like the German scholar Donnus Nicolaus Germanus. Donnus Nicolaus'1466 Latin manuscript of Ptolemy's Geographia was subsequently dedicated to the duke and he received 100 gold ducats for it. 25 The pattern of patronage established for the production of new geographical texts, and adapted throughout the courts offifteenth - century Italy, operated on very similar terms to those laid downby Mehmed in Istanbul in the late fifteenth century, a fact which has onthe whole been disregarded in critical accounts of the place of the Ottomans in the culture ofearly modem Europe.26 Both the Amirutzes commission itself and the subsequent model ofpatronage employed by Mehmed can be seen to breach the perceivedgeographical and intellectual boundaries of the European Renaissance, which have excluded Ottoman culture, even more than Arabic culture, as exhibiting little concern for scholarly learning and thus completelydivorced them from the formation of'western'cultural values. Mehmed'spatronage ofAmirutzes'Ptolemy exemplifies the knowing participation ofthe Ottoman court in the transmission and ultimate shape ofclassical textssubsequently judged to be crucial in the formation of the Europeanwestern tradition. This underlines the extent to which the European inheritance of the Graeco - Roman tradition was equally suffused with theachievements of Arabic scholars based firmly within the bounds of the Ottoman empire. It can only be concluded that with the rapid exchangeof scholars and artists between Istanbul and Italy towards the end of thefifteenth century, Berlinghieri was only too aware that, both in terms ofpolitical power and intellectual inheritance, Mehmed was the most appropriate patron for his Geographia. Subsequent clandestine exchanges of geographical material between Italy and Istanbul suggest that scholars and diplomats other than Berlinghieri were aware of Mehmed's scholarly interest in geography, and thatthe Ottoman sultan was also cognizant of the military and diplomatic importance of maps to the expansion of his already vast empire. Matteo de'Pasti's visit to Istanbul in 1461 at the behest of Sigismondo Malatesta, mentioned earlier, offers a more covert account of the traffic in geographical information. De'Pasti's journey was ostensibly a cultural visit designedto assist Mehmed in the building ofhis new imperial palace. Off Crete, de'Pasti was captured by Venetian officials, who returned him to Venicewhere he was accused of being a spy in league with the Ottomans. In hispossession the authorities found Sigismondo's letter to Mehmed, inwhich the Lord ofRimini announced: The greatness of your majesty is such that its formidable power easily exceedsthe capacity not simply of myself, but of the whole human race. It seemed tome, therefore, that if what I should offer was to be of sufficient stature it shouldbe something close to me personally, and unique to me, something which I believed would thereby give you the greatest pleasure. So I have decided to makeyou companion to my studies and my pleasures, and to share with you a substantial and erudite work on military matters, in which are to be found thegreat leaders and imperial rulers not simply of our own time, but of precedingages, all ofwhom, incontrovertibly, and with one voice you are acknowledged toexcel and surpass in merit. 27 The manuscript which Sigismondo delegated de'Pasti to present to Mehmed was Roberto Valturi's highly influential Dp re milz\"tari, an illustrated work on military arms and tactics. Accompanying it was anotherdocument of crucial diplomatic importance - a detailed manuscript mapofItaly.28 Contemporary accounts suggest that this map contained logistical and military information vital to any subsequent Ottoman advance on Venice and the Italian peninsula. Sigismondo's anti - Venetian feelings werewell known, and it appears that he was prepared to encourage Mehmed toinvade Italy with the offer of detailed cartographic information whichwould be of great value to the authorities in Istanbul. Such threats werenot taken lightly by the Venetians, and their response to de'Pasti's breachof security was validated in the light of Mehmed's eventual invasion of Italy in the summer of 1480, when Gedik Ahmed Pasha landed a force of 18,000 soldiers at Otranto. A badly mutilated map of the Venetian territories specifying vulnerable ports and military fortifications, dated to the 1470S and still in the possession of the imperial library in Istanbul, suggests that other clandestine maps managed to find their way successfullyinto the hands of the Ottoman court as it planned its assault on Italy inthe final years of the 1470S.29 The traffic in maps, both overt and covert, and geographical information between Italy and Istanbul is symptomatic of the centrality of the Ottoman empire to the social and political dynamics of the evolvingworld of early modem Europe. Its court appears to have been well awareof the significance of appropriating and utilizing classical learning in theservice of political action, and played as crucial a role in the recovery ofclassical texts like Ptolemy's Geographia as the city - states of fifteenthcentury Italy. The elaborate commissioning, and often clandestineappropriation, of a range of geographical material by the Ottoman courtalso suggests that a shared perception of the status of cultural productionand the importance of the mechanics of diplomatic exchange existed between Istanbul and the city - states of Italy. This perception encompassedcultural exchanges predicated on amity, as in the case of Berlinghieri'sattempt to court Mehmed, as well as exchanges predicated on potentialacts of aggression, as in the case of Malatesta's attempt to smuggle a mapof Italy into the Ottoman court. Neither exchange was predicated on theperception of the Ottomans as mysterious, demonic others, anterior tothe culture of a confidently self - defined European polity. Such exchangeswere predicated on the belief that the Ottoman empire was a powerfulneighbour with whom it was possible to do both diplomatic and commercial business, and whose political concerns often coincided with those ofthe city - states of fifteenth - century Italy. Sea Matters: Ottoman Cartography in the Mediterranean The maps discussed so far invariably concerned the mapping of land andstrategic locations across which diplomats and armies moved like pieces onan enormous geographical chessboard. The difficulties associated withkeeping track of the movements of ever larger armies in time and space, and the problems which emerged from the administration of the increas - 13 ingly large tracts of territory that began to come under the control of centralized imperial authority, made the need for such territorial mapsimperative. However, they remained something of a novelty even by theend of the fifteenth century. To some extent this explains the relative scarcity of the maps already discussed. The fact that the Ottoman authoritieswere quick to capitalize on the scarce geographical resources that wereavailable, in order to facilitate the administration and potential dominationofthe enormous territories to which they laid claim, only emphasizes theiracuity in swiftly perceiving the political importance of maps and geographical information. Nevertheless, the commercial rhythms which definedthe maritime world of the Mediterranean continued to operate with littleregard for the diplomatic machinations which took place on land. Themanuscript portolan charts which enabled pilots and merchants to navigate throughout the waters of the Mediterranean changed very littlethroughout this period. This was partly as a result of the realization thatthe logistical capabilities of such charts were perfectly matched to thecommercial requirements of the sailors and traders who regularly movedbetween the islands and ports which made up the Mediterranean world. There was also very little need for innovation as, unlike contemporaneous Portuguese navigators who moved along the coast of Africa, Mediterranean pilots rarely had to navigate across uncharted territory whichpotentially questioned or compromised the effectiveness of the standardportolan charts. Historians of cartography have endlessly debated the origin of thesecharts, which date back to at least the twelfth century. Recent critical consensus has argued that the portolan tradition probably emerged fromeither Genoa or Catalonia, two of the most prominent trading centreswithin the Mediterranean.30 However, as with cartographic histories ofthe transmission and circulation of Ptolemy's texts amongst the scholarlyelites of the early modem world, this assumption has invariably neglectedthe importance of other early centres of scholarly learning and portolanchart production. A significant amount of early charts were produced inthe North African cities of Tunis and Tripoli.3I One of the earliest extantcharts produced in Arabic, known as the'Maghreb chart' (illus. 33), hasbeen dated 1330 and is believed to have been produced in Granada or Morocco. Drawn by an anonymous Arabic mapmaker, it contains all thestandard traits of the early portolan chart, with its proliferation of rhumblines, exact delineation of coastal territory and place names running perpendicular to the coastline. However, the toponymy tells an interestingstory as to its cultural origin. Of the 202 place names that are identifiable, 48 are ofdefinably Arab origin, whilst the rest are made up ofCatalan, Hispanic and Italian.32 The fact that even charts made throughout the ports of 33 Anon, 'The Maghreb chart', c. 1330, ink on paper. Biblioteca Ambrosiana, Milan. lOS Italy also consist ofplaces and terms derived from Arabic emphasizes theirhybrid nature, suffused with as much Arabic influence as Catalan or Italian. Nor is this surprising considering the amount of influence which Arab communities at both ends ofthe Mediterranean exerted on the commercial and cultural life of the area. The rise to political pre - eminence ofthe Ottomans within the Mediterranean by the fifteenth century also inevitably left its mark on the portolan charts of the period. Amongst itsextensive collection of fifteenth - century charts and sailing atlases, the Topkapi Saray Museum in Istanbul still retains a magnificent chart of theentire Mediterranean made by IbrahIm ibn Ahmad al - KatibI in 1413 - 14 (illus. 34). Prominently displaying the castle of Tunis, where it was produced, and comprehensively labelled in Maghribi script, the chart appearsto have come into the possession of the Ottoman imperial authorities bythe beginning of the sixteenth century, an example of the type requiredby both Italian and Arabic pilots as they sailed throughout the sea lanesof the Mediterranean. Produced by Arabic geographers and pilots, suchcharts shared the geographical coordinates employed by Catalan and Genoese ones, which also presumably drew on the knowledges containedin the Arabic charts as they circulated throughout the Mediterranean. The predominantly commercial exchanges which gave rise to thesecharts meant that the navigational lingua franca of the Mediterranean included Arabic and, increasingly, Turkish components, underlined by thefact that Italian and Catalan merchants did the majority of their businessin commercial centres under Islamic jurisdiction, such as Tripoli, Tunis, Alexandria and, increasingly, Istanbul. Even charts themselves weretraded as valuable merchandise by merchants who held factors throughoutthe Mediterranean. Between 1390 and 1392 Domenach Pujol, a merchantbased in Barcelona, entrusted a collection of portolan charts to one Pere Jalbert, a mariner and factor in his pay, who was given instructions to sellthem throughout the ports of the Mediterranean, including Genoa, Naples, Sicily and Alexandria.33 In Alexandria Jalbert was instructed tobarter the charts for consignments of pepper, a striking example of theways in which these charts moved between cultures as valuable commodities in their own right, exchangeable objects whose value could match theprice of a cargo of pepper. The hybrid lingua franca of the region suggeststhat it is unlikely that they were only ofinterest to Christian pilots, but thatthey were also ofuse to the Arabic pilots who similarly navigated their wayacross the waters of the Mediterranean. The quest for the cultural originsof the portolan chart should therefore be regarded as a futile enterprise, precisely because the Mediterranean world was a shared commercial andintellectual space whose different cultural influences combined to producetrading mechanisms and objects, such as these charts, which were not 34 IbrahIm ibn Ahmad aI - KatabI, portolan chart of the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, 1413 14, vellum. Topkapi Saray Museum. unique to anyone culture or area but emerged as a result of the diverserange of transactions which took place between these cultures. To denythe presence of Arabic and, increasingly, Turkish involvement in the evolution of the portolan chart only reproduces the ideologically weightedcritical belief that the Ottomans played no part in the intellectual development of more scholarly geographical texts like Ptolemy's Geographia. The spectacular rise of the Ottoman empire to political and commercialpre - eminence in the eastern Mediterranean towards the end of the fifteenth century ensured that the balance of power in the region alteredsignificantly. The territorial conquests made under Mehmed II were consolidated during the reign of his son Bayezid, who also ordered thebuilding of an enormous navy to ensure Ottoman control over the coastalareas of its empire. By the winter of 1500 the navy was said to numberaround 400 vessels, which included 200 galleys fitted with heavy cannon, located at bases in Galata on the Black Sea, Avlonya on the Adriatic, Chiosin the Aegean and Macri in the eastern Mediterranean.34 Unmatchedthroughout the Mediterranean in terms of numbers and firepower, thefleet's responsibilities focused primarily on the protection of shippinglanes and the establishment of Ottoman - dominated seaborne traderoutes, rather than outright maritime aggression. Throughout the earlyyears of the sixteenth century it provided the ailing Mamluk regime in Egypt with protection from Portuguese incursions into Mamluk terri - 17 tories. However, this strategic use of the fleet was based on a more wideranging plan to extend Ottoman influence into the Mamluk territories andultimately control the commercially vital shipping lanes of the Red Sea, which brought the majority of merchandise from Asia into mainland Europe. By ISI7 the Ottomans had annexed Egypt, as well as Syria and Yemen, as part of a wider attempt to gain easier access to the seabornetrade routes to India which were being increasingly monopolized by the Portuguese. Not surprisingly, these dramatic advances in Ottoman navaltechnology and power were supported by a whole array of geographicaland navigational information required by the fleet in the attempt to establish its dominance over both the eastern Mediterranean and the Red Sea. One of the commanders of the fleet used in the annexation of Egypt in ISI7 was also responsible for some of the finest maps and charts of the Mediterranean produced in the early years of the sixteenth century. Simply known as Piri Reis, in ISI7 he presented a manuscript map of theworld (illus. 3S) which he had completed in ISI3, to Sultan Selim I in Cairo. In his account ofthis presentation the Turkish commander recalledthat: I, your humble pilot, made maps in which I was able to show twice the numberofthings contained in the maps ofour day. Having made use ofnew maps ofthe Chinese and the Indian Seas which no one in the Ottoman lands had hithertoseen or known, I presented them to the late and deceased Sultan Selim whilehe was in Egypt and received his favour. 35 Whilst only a fragment ofthe western portion ofthis map still survives, thenotes which Piri Reis appended to it emphasize the enormous variety ofgeographical knowledges to which he had access: No such map exists in our age. Your humble servant is its author and brought itinto being. It is based mainly on twenty charts and mappa mundi, one ofwhich isdrawn in the time ofAlexander the Great, and is known to the Arabs as Caferiye [dja'grafiye]. This map is the result of comparison with eight such [dja'grafiye] maps, one Arab map of India, four new Portuguese maps drawn according tothe geometrical methods of India and China, and also the map of the westernlands drawn by Columbus; such that this map of the seven seas is as accurateand reliable as the latter map of this region.36 There appears to be little doubt that Piri Reis consulted Arabic, Greek and Italian copies of Ptolemy's Geographia available to him in Istanbul, as wellas more recent portolan charts ofboth Portuguese and Indian provenance. As a naval commander with exposure to the scholarly geography of Ptolemy, as well as practical involvement with voyages which broughthim into contact with both Portuguese portolan charts and the localcharts of the Indian Ocean which were so coveted by the Portuguese 35 In P. Reis world map, 1513, vellum. Topkapi ara yMuseum. crown, it would be no exaggeration to claim that by 1517 Piri Reis hadaccess to one of the most comprehensive collections of geographical information available to any scholar or pilot active in the early modern world. His world map was not only one ofthe most detailed to be produced in thefirst decades of the sixteenth century. It was also one of the first maps toaccount systematically for the significance of Columbus'voyages to the Americas. That Piri Reis should present such a map of the world to an Ottoman sultan, himself intent on imperial expansion on a global scale, clearly refutes any notions that the Ottomans took no interest in geographical matters or the global expansion of other empires within theearly modern world. Nor did Piri Reis'cartographic activities end there. In the ensuing yearsthe Turkish commander set to work on compiling one of the most comprehensive collections of portolan charts of the Mediterranean to beproduced in the early sixteenth century. By 1521 Piri Reis had completedhis manuscript. Entitled Kitiib - i babriye (translated as'Manual of maritime or sea matters'), it was a comprehensive account of the sailingdirections required to navigate throughout the Mediterranean. By 1526 Piri Reis completed an even longer version ofthe text. It contained 216 exquisitely drawn portolan charts of the region (illus. 9) accompanied by 130 chapters of detailed hydrographic description of islands, coastlines, andfortifications which Piri Reis had traversed throughout his career with the Turkish fleet. In the same year he presented the completed manuscript to Sultan Siileyman the Magnificent. However, the Turkish admiral did notdraw the geographical limit ofhis cartographic enquiries at the Mediterranean alone. In a radical move indicative ofthe extent to which the portolanchart began to adapt to the expanding political and commercial parametersofthe early modem world, Piri Reis presented Siileyman with a copy ofthe Kitiib - i babriye complete with significant new additions to the first manuscript, which were to be of particular interest to the new sultan. Theseoffered a detailed outline of the development of Portuguese explorationfrom the first voyages down the west coast of Africa in the fifteenth century right up to the contemporary establishment of Portuguesecommercial hegemony in the Indian Ocean. With remarkable accuracy Piri Reis recounted the exploits of Bartolomeu Dias and the subsequentdiscovery and geographical position of the Cape of Good Hope: He was the one who found the land of the Abyssinians and the Cape of Good Hope. For what they call Kavu Bono Ispiranse is what we refer to as Umiz Burnu. They sought this place mile by mile and discovered it in the ninth year. This place is the beginning of the route to India and this is why they made ittheir goal to find it. Every year they advanced a thousand miles. At the farthest place they reached, they set up a marker and returned. When the sailing season returned, they would come back and seek this marker. And from there, they immediately set out to go further but they were unable tofind the open sea. So as not to be misled on their course, they also traversed the shores on foot. In this way they measured the land, furlong by furlong, advancing on their way. Those who discovered Kavu Bono Ispiransa set up there a column and a crucifix. They held a great celebration there, for they had found the way to India. Know then that this Umiz Burnu is the farthest extremity of the continents ofthe world. This place is part of the southern region and it lies beyond the Equator. That cape lies thirty - four degrees below the Equator.37 The remarkable accuracy of Piri Reis'geographical information wasmatched only by his extensive knowledge of the development of maritime Portuguese cartography throughout the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. This was reflected in his highly accurate assessment of therelationship between cartography and the successful commercial expansion of the Portuguese crown: In Portugal there was an influential priest who was thoroughly versed in allthings. Skilled in theoretical and practical knowledge, he had attained perfection. Through constant effort he had become a philosopher. He created a ball shaped like an apple on which he marked the lands and the seas. On that globe he indicated all the distances and calculated its size to be twentyfour thousand miles. He marked the various countries and wrote their names on the globe. And at the same time he recorded on it the islands in the seas and countlessnumbers of castles. Using this globe, one can travel the whole world across the Ocean, as far as China.38 The'influential priest'appears to be a reference to Fra Mauro, whoseworld map commissioned by the Portuguese crown reached Lisbon in 1459. The'ball shaped like an apple'refers to Martin Behaim's famous terrestrial globe, used by Magellan in his circumnavigation of the globe in 1522, and argued to have influenced Columbus'voyage of 1492. Thedetail of Piri Reis'account suggests an acquired knowledge of not onlythe geographical artefacts associated with Portugal's seaborne expansion, but also an awareness of early Portuguese chronicles which narrated thehistory of this expansion in terms strikingly similar to the description offered by Piri Reis. However, to read his comments as the awed response ofsomeone unfamiliar with such cartographic developments does not accordwith the evidence of Ottoman navigational advances made during this I I I period. Such advances suggest that Piri Reis may have been rather puzzledby the limitations of Portuguese cartography. The accuracy with which Arabic pilots navigated throughout the Indian Ocean, using a variety of instruments from which they measured the altitude of the sun and theposition of the stars (techniques clearly known to Piri Reis from his ownnaval experiences throughout both the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean), must have made the much - vaunted maps and globes of Fra Mauro and Behaim seem disappointingly simplistic to someone as geographically experienced as the Turkish commander. As a lavishly designed text ceremonially presented to Siileyman the Magnificent, Piri Reis'Kitab - i babriye appears to have followed in thepath ofearlier examples ofOttoman cartography as both an aid to navigational expertise and a prized political object, part of the diplomaticapparatus utilized by the Ottoman court in the pursuit of an ambitiouslyexpansionist foreign policy. Piri Reis was, like his contemporaries in the Italian mapmaking industry, only too aware of this dual function whichhis charts and geographical observations served, as his comments ontheir value to those in the diplomatic profession suggest:... those who are masters of this profession may by applying that which is written in this book and with the grace of God facilitate all their affairs, even if theyhave never seen or been acquainted with such places, and they will have no needof pilots.39 Whilst the claim that the Ottoman authorities would'have no need ofpilots'in their utilization of the Kitab - i babriye may have been rather optimistic, Piri Reis'comments suggest that he was convinced of the ability ofhis charts to facilitate diplomatic, commercial, naval and military logisticsto the advantage of the empire. With remarkable insight he realized thatthe intellectual and commercial parameters of the Mediterranean worldwere becoming increasingly diffuse with the impact of both Columbus'voyages to the Americas and da Gama's expedition to India, and that anycollection ofportolan charts based on the Mediterranean had to reflect thislevel of geographical diversity. As a result, his text was not only a significant Ottoman addition to the culturally hybrid tradition ofMediterraneanportolan chartmaking, but it was also partly responsible for resituating theportolan chart within a wider commercial and geographical context thanhad previously been the case. The central cause ofthis widening ofgeographical focus emanated fromthe changing commercial dynamics of the Mediterranean world whichproceeded Portugal's successful establishment of the trade route to Indiavia the Cape of Good Hope. Piri Reis'Kitab - i babriye reflected this shiftin commercial and political awareness, and emphasized the extent towhich the Ottomans were aware of the need to produce geographical andhydrographical information which kept up with the pace of change in the Mediterranean world and beyond. The manuscript was therefore also avaluable source of information on the effects which the Portuguese werehaving on the trade throughout the Indian Ocean, which, by extension, affected the nature of trade in the Mediterranean. In his description of Hormuz, whose strategic location at the entrance to the Persian Gulfmade it a vital conduit in the movement of merchandise between boththe Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean, Piri Reis noted: But now the Portuguese have reached this place and they have built a fort on that Cape. There they wait and collect tolls from ships that pass. You have now learned thecircumstances of this place. The Portuguese have overcome them all and the khans of the island are filledwith their merchants. In fall or summer, no trading takes place unless the Portuguese are present. 40 The gathering of geographical information for the completion of the Kitdb - i ba~rlye can be seen here as coterminous with the collection ofcommercial information on the adverse effect that strategic Portuguesepossession of commercially vital cities and ports such as Hormuz washaving, not only on the revenues of the Ottoman empire but also on thetrade of the Mediterranean more generally. The Portuguese capture of Hormuz in 1515 did signal a measure of Portuguese pre - eminence in thetrade throughout the Indian Ocean, in practice forcing local traders to purchase cartazes which obliged them to pay customs duties on allmerchandise direct to the Portuguese authorities. It is bitterly ironic that it was Piri Reis'ability to keep the Ottoman courtabreast of these developments in the Persian Gulf that was to lead ultimately to his death. In 1547 he was appointed admiral of the Ottomanfleet by Siileyman, with orders to oppose the growing commercial andnaval power of the Portuguese in the Indian Ocean. In 1549 he completedthe first stage ofhis mission by taking the city ofAden. By 1552 the Turkishadmiral was laying siege to Hormuz, but with the arrival of Portuguesenaval reinforcements he was forced back to Egypt. Forbidden to return tothe Persian Gulf for his failure to take Hormuz, he was beheaded in Cairoin 1554 on the orders of his former geographical patron, Siileyman the Magnificent.4I Whilst Piri Reis'cartographic achievements arguablymade Ottoman naval confrontation with the Portuguese in the Persian Gulf possible, it would seem that his geographical acumen could not savehim in the face of naval defeat. Nevertheless, his Kitdb - i ba~riye made anenormous, if historically neglected, contribution to the tradition ofMediterranean portolan chartmaking. The information gathering which wentinto these charts suggests that a much more fluid exchange of hydrographical and commercial information brought such charts into being thanhas previously been conceded by historians of cartography. Piri Reis'textis littered with comments signifying that his information was obtainedathwart the political divisions which ostensibly structured the diplomaticconfrontations ofthe period. In his account ofthe Portuguese involvementin China and the trade in porcelain, he notes that'I asked these Portuguese 2 As has been seen, at the same time the Portuabout this land of China'.4 guese were busy gathering nautical information on the sea routes between East Africa and China from Muslim andJavan pilots. A level of geographical exchange was apparently taking place which circulated information onnavigation, topography and commerce that far exceeded the traditionalpolitical distinctions which historians have claimed informed the publicrhetoric of both Ottoman and Christian authorities as they struggled forcommercial and political pre - eminence in the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean. Existing between the practical portoIan charts usedthroughout the early sixteenth - century Mediterranean and the diplomatically valuable copies of Ptolemy circulated between the elites of Florence, Venice and Istanbul, Piri Reis'Kittib - i ba~riye signified, in both its politicalstatus at the Ottoman court and its geographical range of reference, thatthe perception of the Ottomans and their'eastern'empire as the exoticized, mysterious and feared antithesis to the classical civic humanism of Renaissance Italy was a myth. The cultural and commercial transactionsmediated through scholarly geographical texts such as Ptolemy's Geographia and Piri Reis'portolan charts expose the fallaciousness of argumentsclaiming that the Ottomans were geographically isolated from the politicaland diplomatic contexts of'Renaissance Europe'. Such transactions alsogive the lie to the traditional belief that the Ottomans were indifferent tothe cultural production and commercial exchanges which took placethroughout the Mediterranean.43 Other Geographies? Whilst Piri Reis'geographical activities resulted in perhaps the most spectacular and comprehensive examples of early sixteenth - century Ottomancartography, they were not the only ones produced at this time. The coninfluence of the Ottoman empire on sea and landtinuing politicalthroughout the sixteenth century stimulated a whole range of geographicalinitiatives developed by Turkish scholars, architects, artists anddiplomats.44 Having absorbed the advantages of utilizing territorial mapssuch as those contained within Ptolemy's Geographia in envisioning territorial conquest, Suleyman the Magnificent engaged the services of the Turkish topographer Matra~c;INa~uQu to record the progress of his military campaign againstthe Safavids between 1533 and 1536. Thesubsequent manuscript atlas of the campaign, completed in 1537 and entitled Beyani - i Menazil - i Sefer - i Irakeyn - i Sultan Siileyman! jan, contained 107 elevated landscape miniatures of Siileyman's campaign. So successfulwas the atlas in establishing a visual rhetoric of territorial conquest that Matra~c;Iwascommissioned again in 1542 to record Siileyman's territorialand naval attacks on his imperial adversary the Habsburg emperor Charlesv. Entitled Tarih - i Fetb - i Si~16~ ve Estergon ve Istiinibelgrad, Matrakc;i'stopographical plans contained depictions of Siileyman's march on Hungary, as well as miniature plans of Mediterranean ports which cameunder Ottoman attack throughout 1542 and the subsequent year. Theseincluded maps and plans of Toulon, Marseilles, Antibes, Genoa and Nice45 (illus. 36). Nor did Siileyman's campaigns on land result in the waning ofOttomannautical cartography. By the late 1550S, prior to Siileyman's death in 1566, a collection ofsea atlases which included comprehensive maps ofthe worldhad been produced by mapmakers based in Istanbul. The anonymous Deniz atlasi, tentatively dated to 1560, not only contains a series of portolancharts of the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, but also a detailed chart ofthe Indian Ocean, as well as a map of the world (illus. 37). Its successor, theso - called'Ali Macar Reis atlas, dated 1567, contains six portolan chartsand a world map with similarities to the Deniz atlasi. As Macar means Hungarian in Turkish, it seems likely that its author, 'Ali Macar, was infact a Hungarian geographer working for the Ottoman authorities, whosecharts drew on his experience of both Ottoman and European regions tocreate a comprehensive atlas focused primarily on the Mediterranean. By 1570, the same year that Abraham Ortelius published his monumental Theatrum Orbis Terrarum, another anonymous Turkish geographer completed the so - called Atlas - i hiimayun, which appears to have drawn onboth the Deniz atlasi and the'Ali Macar Reis atlas. 46 But perhaps no better example of the scale and extent of Ottoman cosmographical and geographical investigation can be invoked than the Ottoman miniature depicting the activities of the Turkish court astronomer Takiyiiddin, at work in his observatory in Istanbul in the 1580s (illus. 8). The observatory was built in 1575 with the support of Takiyiiddin'simperial patron, Murad III, and acted as the focus for the geographicaland celestial enquiries of the astronomer and his fellow cosmographers.47 Lining the back wall are precious manuscripts (including, no doubt, copiesof Ptolemy) of the type being consulted by Takiyiiddin and his assistants. In the middle ground cosmographers take measurements with astrolabes, quadrants and compasses, whilst in the foreground stands a terrestriallIS 36 Ma~ra\"lYiN~u1). u,Nice, from the Tarih - i Fet~ - i!$ikliif ve Estergon ve Istt1nibelgrad, c. 1543. Topkapi Saray Museum. globe, with Europe and Asia clearly marked, which appears to be based onthe geographical information contained in the Turkish atlases of the previous decade. This illustration ofTakiyiiddin's activities is symptomatic ofthe intense level of geographical enquiry that took place in Istanbul fromits establishment as the Ottoman capital in 1453. Such activity has, however, been marginalized in accounts ofearly modem geography due to itsconnection to an empire which was demonized as simply concerned withthe acquisition of territory in the pursuit of a global Islamic imperialism. Such accounts fail to recognize the sheer diversity ofTurkish geographicalthinking, and the extent to which such thinking interfaced with similar enquiries which were taking place throughout mainland Europe at exactlythe same time. Perhaps the fact that, like the illustration of Takiyiiddin'sobservatory, all the examples ofTurkish cartography which have been analysed were produced in manuscript form, provides one final indication asto their continued occlusion within critical accounts of the Renaissance. The impact of printing on the culture of early modem Europe was without doubt one of the most decisive factors in shaping the political andimaginative parameters of the early modem world. However, the focusupon print as the driving force behind most forms of intellectual develop - t, 37 Anon, world map from the Deniz atlasi, c, 1560, vellum. Walters Art Gallery, Baltimore. ment has been at the expense ofcultures and traditions which continued toexpress their intellectual output through the medium of the manuscript. As the culture of print was not assimilated into the Ottoman empire untilthe beginning of the eighteenth century, it is easy to see why critics havebeen much more reluctant to assess the importance of Ottoman learningwithin the specificities of scribal production. The fact that one of the firsttexts to roll off the printing press of the founder of Turkish printing in 1726 was a map of the Ottoman empire is a poignant reminder of the prestige accorded to the study of geography within the empire. 48 In tracing the circulation ofTurkish maps and charts and their interfacewith both the Ottoman court and the territories over which it held sway, itbecomes possible to define a level of territorial and cultural interaction between Istanbul and its western European counterparts which breaches theartificial geopolitical boundaries of'East'and'West'. The sovereigns andcity - states of early modern Europe were neither politically powerful nordiplomatically cohesive enough to establish a sustained and coherentdemonization of the Ottoman empire. At various times the Ottomansstood as implacable foes, at others as potential allies. In tracing the transactions ofknowledge which produced the remarkably diverse collections ofmaps and charts which characterized political relations throughout earlymodern Europe and the Ottoman empire, it is possible to offer a verydifferent account ofthe relations between communities than is reflected inthe contemporary statements of princes and diplomats, which invariablypainted a picture of ideological conflict and religious antagonism. As aresult, the study of early modern Europe is perhaps now at the stagewhere there is a possibility, as Edward Said has recently argued, 'of rethinking and reformulating historical experiences which had once beenbased on the geographical separation of peoples and cultures'.49 This iscertainly the case in critical perceptions of the relations between earlysixteenth - century Europe and the Ottoman empire. In redrawing the map of the early modern world in this way, the statusof maps themselves can be similarly reconsidered by following their various diplomatic and commercial trajectories as they moved betweenlocales such as Florence, Venice, Istanbul and Cairo. The portolan mapsand charts of Piri Reis, and the later Turkish atlases, graphically portraythe complex relations between communities throughout the Mediterranean, and reflect how it becomes impossible to delimit them into simplecategories of Christian or Muslim, European or Turk. The geographicaltexts of the likes of Berlinghieri and Amirutzes also point to the status ofscholarly maps as skilfully marketed luxury objects which could be offeredto, or produced within, the powerful Ottoman court. Imbued with arcanediplomatic and commercial knowledges, which only served to enhancetheir status as valued objects, such maps were politically and aestheticallyappreciated by Christian and Muslim owners alike. As a result, it becomesimpossible to sustain the Orientalist myth of the exotic, peripheral figureof the despotic Turk, which has implicitly informed so many accounts ofthe development ofearly modern Europe.50 4 Cunning Cosmographers: Mapping the Moluccas The previous two chapters circulated around the diplomatic and commercial disputations which saw the great empires of the early modem worldstruggling for nautical and commercial supremacy over the prized traderoutes which crisscrossed the Indian Ocean. By 1517 the Portuguese hadestablished a monopoly on the spices, pepper and other precious goodsas far east as Malacca by the strength of their naval forces positioned atstrategic locations from West Africa on the Atlantic Ocean to Goa and Malacca on the Indian Ocean. However, their naval seapower was desperately overstretched in its attempts to police these seaborne trade routeswhilst also trying to combat the persistent incursions of the Ottomanfleet throughout the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean. Even more significantly the Portuguese crown had attempted to establish a completemonopoly on all pepper coming into Europe via the Cape route from 1504, in order to fix prices and thus ensure a guaranteed profit.! However, this strategy began to backfire almost as soon as it was instituted by Manuel I, who became known as the'grocer king'. Dissatisfied localpepper merchants throughout the Indian subcontinent returned to theold overland trade routes to sell their pepper to Venetian merchants, whowere prepared to negotiate the price. The decision to establish a spice andpepper monopoly in Lisbon also had serious repercussions for Germancapital, which had relocated there in the aftermath of da Gama's voyageto ensure that merchants could buy these imports and ship them to markets in northern Europe. In 1516 the commercial representative for theinfluential House of Fugger, Cristobal de Haro, withdrew from Lisbon inprotest at the new monopoly, which was making it increasingly difficult forthe Fugger to reap any substantial profit from the pepper trade. 2 De Harochose to settle in Seville, \".11\\ re he hoped to encourage Castile to challengethe Portuguese spice and pepper monopoly by following in Columbus'footsteps and sailing westwards, rather than eastwards, to capture thefinal prized possession in the spice trade: the Moluccas Islands. The spices which had trickled into the markets of mainland Europe foryears were one of the most sought after condiments within the domesticeconomy of early modern Europe (illus. 38). Not only were they used toflavour monotonous and often rancid meat dishes, but as their reputationgrew they became renowned for their various abilities to strengthen eyesight, cure dropsy and eliminate liver pains. To capture the tiny islands ofthe Moluccas was effectively to capture one of the most plentiful suppliesof spices available throughout Southeast Asia. Situated to the east of Malacca on the rim of the Pacific Ocean, the islands had been for manyyears the primary source of high - quality pepper distributed throughoutthe trading emporia of the Indian Ocean. In 1511 the Portuguese navalcommander d'Albuquerque had captured the commercially vital city of Malacca on the southern tip ofthe Malay peninsula, to where the majorityof the pepper produced in the Moluccas was shipped for wider distribution. Its strategic importance to the Portuguese had been emphasized bythe diplomat Tome Pires, who noted in his Suma Oriental written duringthe same period that: Men cannot estimate the worth of Malacca, on account of its greatness andprofit. Malacca is a city that was made for merchandise, fitter than any other inthe world.3 From their base in Malacca the Portuguese endeavoured to take possession of the Moluccas and claim the finallink in the complicatedcommercial chain which constituted the spice trade. However, the Portuguese crown came up against a diplomatic obstacle even greater than thenavigational difficulties which faced its sailors in reaching the Moluccas. The Treaty ofTordesillas, which had been signed in 1494 in the aftermathofColumbus'discoveries in the western Atlantic, had provisionally settledthe territorial dispute between Portugal and Castile as to where theirmutual spheres of territorial influence extended. However, by fixing theline of demarcation 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands, in the Atlantic, it only postponed the inevitable diplomatic dispute as to wherethis line should fall in the eastern hemisphere, if it was to be extendedand drawn right round the globe. The treaty was clearly drawn on a flatmap of the known world, rather than a globe which would have allowedthe two crowns to partition the world like splitting an apple in two. However, geographical knowledge in 1494 could literally not encompass theentire globe as, prior to the Portuguese voyages, nothing was known withany degree of accuracy of the geographical coordinates of the Indian Ocean, or those of the still as yet undiscovered Pacific Ocean. In 1513, asthe Portuguese dispatched voyages to raid the still independent Moluccasislands, the Castilian adventurer Vasco Nunez de Balboa crossed the Isthmus of Darien in Central America and became the first known Europeanto sight the Pacific Ocean.4 News of his sighting fuelled growing specula - 38 Boucicmt Master, 'Pepper harvest in Coilum', illumination from Marco Polo, Livre des Marveilles, c. 1410. Bibliotheque Nationale de France, Paris. tion as to where the line of demarcation between the two crowns was to bedrawn in the eastern hemisphere, somewhere between Balboa's discoveryin the west and the Portuguese in Malacca to the east. In the rapid attempt to assimilate such information, the apprehension ofthe world ofearly modem diplomacy took on a perceptibly global perspective. The significance of Balboa's discovery and the Portuguese pursuit ofthe Moluccas gave the early modem world a definably global outlook withthe prize, to whoever could complete this geographical circle, of virtualcontrol ofthe lucrative spice trade. This chapter deals with the commercialcompetition for the Moluccas Islands which preoccupied European diplomacy for nearly two decades, and the remarkable diplomatic andgeographical debates which it produced. The political controversy whichsurrounded the Moluccas placed cartography at the centre of the debate, as both geographers and diplomats strove to accommodate the implications of the Portuguese and Castilian voyages into their world picture, whilst princes and merchants sought to utilize both maps and globes ascentral bargaining apparatuses in their political dispute over the spiceislands. The dispute was to inspire not only the first complete circumnavigation of the globe, but also an explosion in global cartography whichestablished a whole industry of globemaking as the discipline of cartography and a whole range of geographers and mapmakers cashed in onthe political and cultural esteem accorded to their intellectual labours. The dispute ultimately established the contours of a recognizablymodem global image of the world, as well as finally professionalizing thediscipline of geography as a highly politicized, as well as educationally influential, field of intellectual enquiry. Sailing West to the East: The Questfor the Moluccas The news of Balboa's sighting of the Pacific in 1513 soon reached Castile, and the ears of the Fugger representative who had recently moved to Seville, Cristobal de Haro. De Haro appears to have been more convincedthan ever of the possibility of following Columbus and Balboa by sailingwest into the Atlantic to take possession of the Moluccas in the'east'. Throughout 1516 he began developing plans to finance a voyage from Castile to the islands. By early 1517 he had acquired the services of a pilotwhom he believed had the ability to lead an expedition to the spice islandsby sailing south - west: the Portuguese sailor Fernao de Magalhaes, betterknown by his Hispanicized name Ferdinand Magellan (illus. 39). Magellanhad already spent several years in the Portuguese fleet in the Indian Ocean, and had taken part in the capture of Malacca in 151I.5 He was thus perfectly equipped with the nautical and commercial knowledges required tolaunch a renewed assault on the Moluccas. By encouraging him to undertake such a voyage under the Castilian flag, de Haro and his businesscolleagues emphasized the extent to which economic considerations overrode national affiliation in the commercial pursuit of an alternative traderoute to the islands. The first account of Magellan's now famous voyagewas written by Maximilianus Transylvanus, counsellor to Charles V, astudent of the famous geographical scholar Peter Martyr and relative of Cristobal de Haro. Transylvanus published his account of the voyage in Cologne in January 1523. Entitled De Moluccis Insulis, Transylvanus'textrecounted the reasons for de Haro's choice of pilot, and the commercialmotivations which lay behind the projected voyage: Four years ago, Ferdinand Magellan, a distinguished Portuguese who had formany years sailed about the Eastern Seas as admiral of the Portuguese fleet, having quarrelled with his king who he considered had acted ungratefully towards him, and Christopher Haro, brother of my father - in - law, ofLisbon, whohad through his agents for many years carried on trade with those Eastern countries and more recently with the Chinese, so that he was well acquainted withthese matters (he also, having been ill - used by the king of Portugal, had returned to his native country, Castile), pointed out to the emperor [Charles V] that it was not yet clearly ascertained whether Malacca was within the boundaries of the Portuguese or the Castilians, because hitherto its longitude had notbeen definitely known; but it was an undoubted fact that the Great Gulfand the Chinese nations were within the Castilian limits. They asserted also that it wasabsolutely certain that the islands called the Moluccas, in which all sorts ofspices grow, and from which they were brought to Malacca, were contained in 39 Portrait ofMagellan, engraving in Theodor de Bry, Voyages, Frankfurt, 1610. British Library, London. the Western, or Castilian division, and that it would be possible to sail to themand to bring the spices at less trouble and expense from their native soil to Castile.6 Transylvanus'text, which was widely circulated amongst the financialcommunity of Augsburg, makes it quite clear that not only was the singular aim of the voyage to'search for the islands in which spices grow', butalso that de Haro's financial input into the voyage was crucial to thewhole project. The influential Castilian historian of the Americas, Bishop Bartolome de Las Casas, in his account of Magellan's justification forbasing his project in Castile, recalled the significance of the geographicalinformation which the Portuguese sailor took with him when he left Lisbon: Magellan brought with him [to Seville] a well - painted globe showing the entireworld, and thereon traced the course he proposed to take, save that the Strait waspurposely left so that nobody could anticipate him... I asked him what route heproposed to take, he replied that he intended to take that of Cape Santa Maria (which we call Rio de la Plata) and thence follow the coast up [south] until hefound the Strait. I said, 'What will you do if you find no strait to pass into theother sea?' He replied that ifhe found none he would follow the course that the Portuguese took. But, according to what an Italian named Pigafetta ofVincenzawho went on that voyage ofdiscovery with Magellan, wrote in a letter, Magellanwas perfectly certain to find the Strait because he had seen on a nautical chartmade by one Martin of Bohemia, a great pilot and cosmographer, in the treasury of the King ofPortugal the Strait depicted just as he found it. And, becausethe said Strait was on the coast of land and sea, within the boundaries of thesovereigns of Castile, he [Magellan] therefore had to move and offer his servicesto the king of Castile to discover a new route to the said islands of Molucca andthe rest. 7 Magellan's utilization of knowledge apparently gleaned from Martin Behaim's geographical information is supported by the travel account subsequently published by Antonio Pigafetta, who sailed with Magellan. Inhis account Pigafetta noted that: The captain - general said that there was another strait which led out, saying thathe knew it well and had seen it in a marine chart ofthe King ofPortugal, which agreat pilot and sailor named Martin ofBohemia had made.8 What is so significant here is that Magellan used Behaim's geographicalinformation not necessarily for its precision, but for its globular dimensions, the only dimensions that would have been of any use to him as hesought to join up the two hemispheres of the world. It is also telling thatin the face ofthe internationalist nature ofde Haro's assault on the Moluccas, allegiance to crown and country were rapidly sacrificed. Thecommentaries of Transylvanus and Las Casas make it clear that this wasa commercial venture which seamlessly transgressed established limits ofnational and imperial sovereignty. Magellan's projected voyage was in facta trading venture which brought together a Portuguese pilot (Magellan), using a chart (or globe) belonging to a German (Behaim), employing an Italian chronicler (Pigafetta) in a German - financed voyage, cashing in onhis privileged access to sensitive Portuguese information, and flying underthe flag ofCastile. The level ofdiplomatic, technical and intellectual expertise required for such an ambitious long - distance commercial voyageensured that money was quickly made available to purchase such knowledge, regardless of the obstacles of national or regional allegiance. Nor was Magellan the only specialist lured to Seville by de Haro. By thetime preparations for the voyage were complete in the summer of1519, theteam of geographical experts and advisers who surrounded Magellan included Ruy Faleiro, appointed chief pilot and supervisor of maps andinstruments, the brothers Pedro and Jorge Reinel, cosmographicaladvisers, and Diogo Ribeiro, official chartmaker to the voyage.9 All fourof these highly respected figures were not only Portuguese, but had alsoall been appointed by royal command to positions of authority in the Portuguese Casa da india, which oversaw the commercial and geographical regulation of trade along the seaborne route to India. In anotheraccount of the motives behind Magellan's decision to sail south - west tothe Moluccas, the Castilian historian Bartholome Leonardo de Argensola, in his Conquista de las islas Malucas published in Madrid in 1609, outlinedthe involvement of Magellan's Portuguese compatriots in the voyage, aswell as offering further specific details on his intellectual and geographicaljustification for the voyage. Argensola recorded that Magellan, returningfrom his stint in Malacca in 151 I: Consider'd, that since the Moluccos were 600 Leagues East from Malacca, whichmake 30 Degrees, little more or less, they were out of the Portuguese Limits, according to the antient Sea Chart. Returning to Portugal he found no Favour, butthought himself wrong'd, and resenting it, went away into Castile, carrying withhim a Planisphere, drawn by Peter Reynel; by which, and the Correspondence hehad held with Serrano, he perswaded the Emperor, Charles V that the Molucco Island belong'd to him. It is reported, That he confirm'd his opinion with Writings, and the authority of Ruy Faleyro, a Portuguese Judiciary Astrologer. 10 Argensola's account of Magellan's reasons for defecting from Portugal to Castile suggests that the Portuguese sailor was convinced that if the principles ofthe Treaty ofTordesillas were applied to the geographical positionof the Moluccas the islands would, in effect, lie within the 180 degrees ofthe globe allocated to the Castilian crown and its regent, the Habsburgemperor Charles V. His decision to undertake such a hazardous voyagewas therefore made after extensive practical and intellectual consultationof the widest possible variety of geographical information available, including not only maps, charts and globes, but also the more esotericcosmographical knowledges of savants like Faleiro. His reliance on suchlearned geographical speculation was underlined by the mass ofglobes, instruments and charts with which he fitted out his fleet. As well as'twoplanispheres belonging to Magellan and made by Pedro Reinel, and othercharts for the navigation to India', I I the remnants of the fleet which returned to Europe in 1522 still retained an impressive array of navigationalequipment and geographical artefacts, which included: 23 charts by NUllo Garcia, an Italian cartographer employed by the Council ofthe Indies; 6 pair of dividers, 7 astrolabes (one of brass), 21 wooden quadrantssuch as Columbus used, 35 magnetized needles for the compasses, and 18 halfhour glasses for keeping time... [and] two planispheres by Pedro Reinel. 12 Portuguese agents based in Seville kept their king continually informed onthe progress of the preparations for the voyage, and the importance of themaps and charts of the Reinel brothers and Diogo Ribeiro to the wholeenterprise. On the eve of Magellan's departure in the autumn ofl519 oneofJoao's agents reported to him with further details of the forthcomingvoyage: The route which is said to be followed is from San Lucar directly to Cape Frio, leaving Brazil to the right side until after the demarcation line and from there tosail West Y4 North West directly to Maluco, which Maluco I have seen represented on the round chart made here by the son of ReineI; this was not finishedwhen his father came there, and his father achieved the whole thing and placedthe Molucas lands. From this model have been made all the charts of Diego Ribeiro and also the particular charts and globes. 13 Magellan's navigational plans were clearly no longer informed simply bythe logistical difficulty offinding his way across open seas to the Moluccas. As the comment on sailing either side of'the demarcation line'makesclear, the artificially created lines of territorial division established by the Iberian crowns in the Treaty ofTordesillas attempted to circumscribe themovement ofsailors and pilots, whose world view became increasingly defined through the decisions made by diplomats and merchants back in Europe. By September 1522 preparations for the voyage were complete, and on 22 September Magellan's fleet of five ships sailed out of the Castilian portof San Lucar de Barrameda bound for the Moluccas. Sailing out into the Atlantic, Magellan proceeded down the coast of Brazil and then sailedsouthwards in an attempt to find a strait which would allow him passageinto the Pacific Ocean. By October 1520, after stopping several times toreassess his position, he found his way into the strait which now bears hisname. By the end of November 1520, after much cautious searching, Magellan had emerged from the strait into the open sea of the Pacific Ocean. From there he set out across the Pacific. One of the difficultieswhich subsequently confronted him was that he was sailing in virtuallyuncharted waters, relying on the conceptual geography of the Geographiato guide him. As Ptolemy's calculations had substantially underestimatedthe extent of the oceans east of India, the journey was far more arduousthan either Magellan or any of his pilots had envisaged. By the spring of 1521 the exhausted fleet arrived in the eastern Philippines, where Magellan himself was killed on 27 April after a skirmish with locals on theisland of Mactan. The remnants of the fleet sailed on towards their destination, and on 6 November they sighted the islands of the Moluccas. After loading a substantial cargo of spices, pepper and cloves, they setsail for Castile via the Cape of Good Hope, led by Juan Sebastian de Elcano. On 8 September 1522 the remaining 18 men of an original crewof 240 arrived back in Seville, having completed the first recorded circumnavigation of the globe. An Insular Obsession: The Diplomatic Dispute over the Moluccas The successful return of the remnants of Magellan's fleet caused a diplomatic sensation. The Portuguese crown, upon hearing of its return, immediately lodged a protest with the sovereign of Castile, the recentlyappointed Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. The Portuguese claimedthat Magellan had effectively encroached upon territory which theyclaimed under the terms of the Treaty ofTordesillas. However, the implications of Magellan's voyage went far beyond this sudden renewal of thelong - standing territorial conflict between the two Iberian crowns. Newsthat Magellan's fleet had circumnavigated the globe was received by a diplomatic community throughout mainland Europe which was graduallybeginning to accept the social and political effects of long - distance commercial travel. The Imperial Diet of Nuremberg, which met in 1522, received the news of the voyage in the midst of its attempts to come toterms with not only the rise of Lutheranism throughout northern Europe, but also the difficulties offorming a united Christian front againstthe Ottoman empire. Perhaps even more significantly, it was locked indebate over the ethical and political problems stemming from the recentgrowth of overseas trade and commercial monopolization. Concerned atthe amount of precious metal leaving their territories to pay for pepperbought in the Indian Ocean, the German princes present at the Diet inveighed against the growing political influence of powerful merchantfamilies such as the Fugger and the Welser, and their hold over the movement of spices between Lisbon and Antwerp which allowed them todictate the (relatively high) price of spices and pepper. The merchantsresponded by pointing to the prosperity of the southern German states, and the potentially disastrous economic consequences for them if themonopolies were lifted. 14 News of the return of Magellan's expedition could only strengthen thehand of the German merchant houses, who stood to profit enormouslyfrom a voyage which they had effectively financed. Information on thevoyage was also eagerly anticipated by prominent supporters of Charles V, who had been persuaded by the German merchants to support thevoyage. They included one of the most senior delegates at the Diet, Francesco Chiericati, the papal nuncio to Germany. Chiericati regularly wroteto Isabella d'Este Gonzago in Mantua, telling her of the Diet's activitiesand resolutions. Throughout December 1522 he informed Isabella of hisattempts to persuade the German states to participate in a Hungarian Croatian front against the Ottomans, whilst also supplying her with hisown sensational news of Magellan's voyage: My servant from Vincenza [Pigafetta] whom I sent from Spain to the Indies hasreturned highly enriched with the greatest and most wonderful things in theworld, and has brought an Itinerary from the day he left Spain until the day ofhis return - which is a wonderful thing. Your Most Illustrious Ladyship shallsoon be acquainted with everything. 15 On 10 January 1523, writing of the growing influence of the'heretical'ideas ofone Martin Luther, Chiericati wrote to Isabella enclosing substantial sections ofTransylvanus'account of Magellan's voyage: First of all, they sailed southwards to those islands in the Oceanic Sea which arecalled Terra Ferma, and round the point, over the Sea of Sur towards the west. Then, turning to the north and east, they found themselves in the great gulf, near the Spice Islands, and sailed through the Persian and Arabian Seas, by the Cape of Good Hope, into the Ethiopian Sea and across the Atlantic, until theyreached the Canary Islands, and returned to their own land by the opposite way, having gained not only great riches, but what is worth more - an immortal reputation. For surely this has thrown all the deeds of the Argonauts into theshade. Here we have read a long account of the expedition, which the Emperor Charles has sent to the Archduke Ferdinand, who has kindly shown it to me, andhas also given me some of the spices which they brought back from those parts, with boughs and leaves of the trees from which they came. Charles has also sentthe Archduke a painted map of the journey, and a bird which is very beautiful, which the kings of those countries bear with them when they go into battle, andsay they cannot die so long as it is at their side. 16 Chiericati's account of the increased diplomatic (and implicitly commercial) significance of the geographical artefact produced as a result of thevoyage, the'painted map', was symptomatic of the centrality of cartography in defining the discursive contexts within which it became possible todiscuss the issue of the Moluccas. Charles'presentation of the map to hisbrother the Austrian archduke Ferdinand shares similarities with the ritualpresentation ofmaps from faraway lands carried out by Portuguese sailorson their return to Lisbon. However, the commercial significance of Magellan's voyage was even more directly tangible than the early tentative Portuguese voyages into the Indian Ocean. Charles'map was displayedalongside the spices and exotic birds recovered from the journey. Thisshould not be perceived as simply the ostentatious display of exotica butrather, as the presence of the map suggests, a nascent classificatory procedure which attempted to controlthe knowledges and commoditiesproduced by long - distance travel. The map offered a fantasy of territorialcontrol over the Moluccas where none in fact existed. However, it also laiditselfopen to extensive manipulation by political and commercial interestsregardless of its geographical accuracy. Within the specific context of Chiericati's relation of diplomatic intrigue to d'Este, the map exuded aparticularly resonant message to Ferdinand, exhibiting Charles V's controlnot only over the production and movement of such materially luxuriousobjects as world maps, but also over the new dominions depicted on theglobe which flew the flag of Castile. Ferdinand was therefore asked notonly to accept the territorial gains made by the likes of Magellan onbehalfofCharles, but also to consider the commercially successful acquisition of prized merchandise such as the spices presented alongside theworld map. This display of intellectual expertise and political rhetoric, packaged into one geographical object, united Charles'claims to both territorial possession and commercial authority, claims which were tosymbolize the clash between Charles and Joao III over the subsequentseven years of protracted diplomatic debate over the possession of the Moluccas. This calculated display of the possession of cartographic'information'also characterized the pages of the sketchbooks kept by Pigafetta whilsttravelling with Magellan. In his sketch map commemorating the arrivalof the fleet in the Moluccas, he depicted the islands of'Malluco'above adrawing of a clove tree labelled'arbore di garofali' (illus. 40). His shrewddepiction ofthe islands emphasized their commercial potentiality, in comparison to which the urgency ofrecording their hydrographic position andbearing came a poor second. As Pigafetta's visual representation of the Moluccas and the commercial impetus behind the circulation of themaps of Ribeiro and the Reinels indicate, such maps laid claim to possession primarily within a commercial, rather than a national, context. However, even this situation precludes a simplistic reading of the systematic implementation of colonial domination. One of the most effectiveaspects of the possession of a map recovered from the rigours of longdistance travel was its ability to instil in its owner a belief in his possessionof the territory depicted, or, within the concerns of commercial entrepreneurs, access to the territories portrayed in their maps and across theirglobes. Such beliefs were invariably reinforced by the producers of mapsand charts (such as Behaim and Berlinghieri) in their attempts to establishfavourable relations with a particular patron. However, the belief in effective possession ofcartographic territory was an illusion, and nowhere moreso than in the case of the Moluccas, whatever someone like Pigafetta mayhave claimed upon his return to Europe. His maps should therefore beseen as defining a provisional field of economic exploration, rather thanthe coherent implementation ofa regime ofcolonial expansion. Such fantasies may have been entertained across the negotiating tables back in Lisbon, Seville and Saragossa, but their cartographic representationsremained just that: fantasy projections of possession. Because of their intense association with the precious merchandisewhich they had in effect helped to obtain, maps and globes ofthe type pre - 40 Antonio Pigafetta, chart ofthe Moluccas, c. 1522, vellum. Yale University Library, New Haven. sented to Ferdinand by Charles V became imbued with the commercialethos of the enterprise as a whole. The geographical paraphernalia which Magellan took with him was itself a calculated investment, a'capital good'taking its place alongside the other goods which were shipped by de Haroand which passed for commodities. The inventory for the voyage includedobjects for trade such as 20,000 hawks bells, 500 pounds ofglass beads, 400 pairs of German knives, a thousand mirrors (graded according to quality), brass bracelets, fish hooks, silk and cotton (of various colours), and silkrobes'made in the Turkish fashion'.17 It was precisely these objects, alongside dividers, quadrants, astrolabes and, perhaps most significantly, mapsand globes, which were displayed, brandished and offered in gift exchanges as Magellan moved throughout the Pacific. One particularly significant incident which highlights the ways in whichgeographical knowledge was deployed beyond the limits of its culturalproduction in an attempt to inspire awe and wonder, was described by Pigafetta in his chronicle of the voyage. He recorded that in March 1520 Magellan stopped for refreshment at Limasawa in the Philippines, aftersuccessfully finding his way into the Pacific Ocean. Pigafetta noted that inhis first meeting with the local king: The captain gave this king a robe of red and yellow cloth, made in the Turkishfashion, and a very fine red cap... After that the captain showed him cloths ofdivers colours, and linen, coral, and many other goods, and all the artillery, several pieces of which he caused to be fired before his eyes, whereby the king wasgreatly astonished. 18 The representation of the'astonished'response of the king is repeated inhis reaction to Magellan's next gesture, which was to show him: A great number of swords, of cuirasses, and bucklers, and then he made two ofhis men exercise at swordplay before the king. And he showed them the marinechart and the compass of his ship, telling him how he had found the strait [bywhich] to come hither, and of the time which he had spent in coming, also howhe had not seen any land. At which the king marvelled. 19 In this account, the map is not only coextensive with the militarism of thesword and the cannon, but it also partakes of the luxury and preciousnessof the'cloths of divers colours'which Magellan exhibits to the king. Aswith earlier Portuguese attempts to ratify the power of the map to thoseunfamiliar with its significance, the encounter foregrounds Magellan'sdesire to stress the technical superiority ofthe European map. The discovery of the passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific, the enormous distancesinvolved, the amount of time spent travelling and the navigational skill required to sustain a coherent course out of sight of land, are all treasuredelements ofMagellan's compasses and charts, but have no meaning whatsoever for the king. Magellan's comments to him are again a reflection onhis own admiration and wonder at the advantages of the chart and theglobe, rather than an accurate account of the ruler's amazement. Themap negotiated an anxious point of encounter for Magellan, displayed asan object encapsulating both technical superiority (underlined by the concomitant display of weaponry and claims to navigational expertise) andostentatious wealth (as it is compared to the fine cloth and coral carriedon board as precious cargo). It was on their return from these particularly fraught and contested encounters overseas that the maps and charts taken on the voyage, and thosecreated en route, came to be re - established by their patrons and backers asparticularly precious objects to be displayed as concrete instantiations ofthe voyages made, and the commercial objectives achieved. The survivingcommander of the voyage, Juan Sebastian de Elcano, was clearly aware ofthis when making his report to Charles V in 1522 on its outcome. Elcanowas the most senior member of Magellan's expedition to survive, and inhis report on its achievements, he wrote that: We discovered many very rich islands, among them Banda, where ginger andthe nutmeg grow, and Zabba, where pepper grows, and Timor, where sandal - 13 1 wood grows, and in all the aforesaid islands there is an infinite amount ofginger. The proof of all these productions gathered in the same islands in which theygrow, we bring to display to Your Majesty.20 Elcano's account offers no doubt as to the aim of the voyage. However, within his confident elaboration ofthe goods to be found in the islands is asignificant moment of ambiguity. Is the'proof the products themselvesshipped back and carefully recorded, or is it the maps, charts and globesbrought back from the voyage? Such objects were approached withveneration and increased admiration, as being imbued with an aura of esoteric knowledge as a direct result ofhaving survived the rigours and dangersof long - distance travel. The maps brought back by the survivors of the expedition were consequently viewed as precious goods, prized possessionshandled along with the cargo. These maps were themselves as eagerlyvalued as cloves and spices, and because oftheir movement and circulationtook on an even greater economic and political significance. The terrestrialglobe depicted in Hans Holbein's famous painting The Ambassadors, painted in 1533, was based on an original Nuremberg globe which meticulously traced Magellan's voyage across its surface (illus. 41). Central to thecomposition's complex representation ofdiplomatic exchange and politicalauthority, the position of the terrestrial globe within the painting is symptomatic ofthe extent to which, in the aftermath ofthe voyage, geographicalknowledge became increasingly vital in the establishment ofpolitical claimsto territorial possession and commercial expansion. In response to Portugal's claim that Magellan's voyage violated Portuguese sovereignty in Far Eastern waters, Charles V cleverly offered tosubmit the dispute to diplomatic arbitration. Whilst the Portuguese wereeager to comply, believing that their superior navigational knowledge ofthearea would confirm their right to the Moluccas, their decision even to countenance arbitration was fatal, as it was tantamount to admitting that Charleshad some claim on the spice islands. The first meeting ofthe two crowns todiscuss the issue took place at Vittoria in February 1524, whereJoao III and Charles V agreed to debate'ownership, possession... navigation andtrade'.22 Whilst initial negotiations proved fruitless in establishing possession, it did lead to the two crowns agreeing in principle that'neither of theparties to this treaty shall dispatch expeditions to Molucca for purposes oftrade or barter',23 and that a working party should be appointed to study thecontroversy on both sides, and reconvene at a later date along the border of Castile and Portugal, between Badajoz and Elvas. In the meantime, Charleswasted no time in compiling a diplomatically and geographically compelling case for possession ofthe Moluccas. By the time the two crowns sat down to discuss the issue again at 41 Hans Holbein, The Ambassadors, 1533, oak. National Gallery, London. Badajoz - Elvas in April 1524, Charles had attempted to reconstruct the retinue ofpredominantly Portuguese geographers who had helped Magellanin preparation for his voyage five years earlier. The delegations consisted ofnine members on each side, as well as technical advisers, mostly comprisedof geographical experts. On the Castilian side sat the Portuguese cartographer Diogo Ribeiro, whose charts had been so influential in planning theroute taken by Magellan in 1519. However, by the time the delegates satdown at Badajoz - Elvas the Reinel brothers, Pedro and Jorge, who were socentral to Magellan's original navigational plans, were now to be foundamongst the Portuguese delegation. Losing the brothers was clearly ablow to the Castilian team who had, as the Portuguese delegate Lopez de Siqueira reported in a letter to Joao III, attempted to woo the Reinelbrothers back into the emperor's camp: I stayed at home these last two days, during this time Pedro Reine! came to seeme and told me confidentially that he has been invited together with his son toenter the Emperor's service. The latter has addressed to them letters signed byhimself and the same proposal was made to Simiio Fernandez. 24 Both the Reinel brothers and Fernandez, a geographical adviser to the Portuguese negotiators, were offered employment with the Castilian delegation at salaries of 3,000 reis a year, more than double the average salaryoffered to such specialists in the pay of the Casa da india in Lisbon. Charles'offer was clearly an attempt to ensure a monopoly on the most advanced geographical information available, as well as an unscrupulousendeavour aimed at neutralizing any Portuguese information whichwould have possibly confirmed Portugal's claim to the Moluccas. However, the Castilian negotiating team had managed to retain the services of Ribeiro, as Richard Eden makes clear in his account of the talkscontained in his translation of Peter Martyr's Decades ofthe New World, published in English in 1555: Nunno Garcia, Diego Rivero, being all expert pilots & cunning in making cardesfor the sea, shuld be present, & brynge foorth theyr globes and mappes withother instrumentes necessarie to declare the situation ofthe Islandes ofthe Malucas abowt which was al the contention and stryfe. 25 Ribeiro's career, from his involvement in Magellan's voyage to his participation in the diplomatic dispute over the position of the Moluccas, became symptomatic ofthe increasing political value and subsequent professionalization accorded to the sixteenth - century geographer. On the eveofMagellan's expedition in March 1519 he had been paid four gold ducatsby the Castilian crown for the preparation of four astrolabes, and by Mayhe had received eight silver reals for charts which he had prepared, presumably for the forthcoming voyage. 26 When the two crowns sat down todiscuss the Moluccas in 1524 Ribeiro was well established in the pay ofthe Castilian crown. Living in Coruna, he was employed as the official cartographer to the Castilian Casa de la Especieria under the direction of Cristobal de Haro, the Fugger agent responsible for initially backing Magellan's voyage. As well as making sailing charts, spheres, world mapsand astrolabes, Ribeiro was busy designing a metal water pump which, ifsuccessful, was to double his wages from 30,000 to 60,000 maravedis. By 1527 de Haro was commissioning Ribeiro to provide Castilian pilots withworld charts to enable them to navigate their way to the spice islands byway of the Cape of Good Hope as well as the newly discovered routethrough Magellan's Strait.27 Exhibiting his geographical knowledges ofthe Cape route gleaned from time spent in the employ of the Portuguesecrown in Lisbon, as well as his experience gained plotting Magellan'scourse to the Moluccas via the west, Ribeiro's expertise was clearly of invaluable help to the Castilian team at Badajoz - Elvas in trying to ratify theirclaim to the spice islands. The obsession with cartographical information and the politics ofgeographical partition which preoccupied the delegates at Badajoz - Elvaswas amusingly underlined by Richard Eden's account of the arrival of the Portuguese negotiating team at the small border town of Quadiana: It so chanced that as Frances de Melo, Diego Lopes of Sequeyra, and other ofthose Portugales of this assemble, walked up the river side of Quadiana, a littleboy who stood keeping his mothers clothes which she had washed, demanded ofthem whether they were those men that parted the world with The emperour. And as they answered, yea: he tooke up his shirt and shewed them his barearse, saying: Come and drawe yowre line here throughe the middest. Whichsaying was afterwarde in every mans mouthe and laughed at in the town of Badajoz.28 The line was in fact not conclusively drawn anywhere at Badajoz - Elvas. Having failed to retain the services ofthe Reinel brothers, the Castilian delegates were apparently unable to present a geographically conclusive casefor possession of the Moluccas. Part of the disputation revolved around aninitial inability to redefine the exact line of demarcation between the twocrowns that had been established under the Treaty of Tordesillas. By insisting that the line in the west be fixed on the island of Sal in the Cape Verdes, the Portuguese claimed that the Moluccas lay 137 degrees east ofthis point, whilst the Castilian delegation argued that the islands lay 183 degrees east of Sal (an astonishing difference of opinion) which, if correct, would place them just three degrees within the Castilian sphere.29 Asneither side possessed the scientific information required to establish aprecise calculation for the measurement of longitude, such differences ofopinion could never be fully resolved and the talks reached stalemate. Charles V attempted to take advantage of the diplomatic impasse overthe next two years by sending a series of fleets along Magellan's route totake the Moluccas by force. However, they consistently failed to successfully negotiate the enormous distances involved in sailing from Seville tothe Moluccas via Magellan's Strait, and in particular the formidable difficulties involved in crossing the still relatively uncharted Pacific Ocean. Such voyages were in fact political folly, as the Castilian crown persistentlyunderplayed the length of the ocean: to admit to its real size would havebeen tantamount to admitting that the Moluccas fell within the Portuguese half of the globe. By the beginning of 1529 Charles had realized thefutility of pursuing an increasingly unprofitable claim to the islands, andbegan to develop another strategy to extract some level of financial gainfrom his claim to them. One potential solution which he had initiallypursued was to combine negotiations over the Moluccas with the arrangements for Joao's marriage to Charles'sister Catherine, which took place in 1525. The emperor had initially offered to pay the Portuguese king a dowryof200,000 ducats, but, as a result ofthe dispute over the Moluccas in 1524, then had the nerve to propose to Joao that the amount be waived, at therate of 4,000 ducats per year, in return for unlimited Portuguese accessto the Moluccas for just six years, after which possession would revert to CharlesPo It is no wonder that in the midst of these diplomatic and matrimonial machinations one of the most celebrated artistic manifestations ofthe union between Joao and Catherine should have been the Spherestapestry series discussed in Chapter One, which prominently displayed Portuguese flags flying over the contested territories of the Indonesianarchipelago. By the spring of1529 Charles had agreed withJoao to return to the negotiating table in an attempt to come to some financial arrangement over thevexed issue of the possession of the Moluccas. Charles was in desperateneed of money in the face of his wars with the French sovereign Franc;ois I, and Joao was keen to safeguard his overseas commercial interests withouthaving to go to war with his powerful brother - in - law. As a result diplomaticdelegations again convened a meeting, this time at Saragossa, to agree theterms ofa new and binding treaty. The weight of geographical evidence infavour ofCharles'claim to the islands was once more invoked, but this timein the form ofpolitical rhetoric designed to strengthen any financial settlement which he felt it advantageous to accept. On 23 April 1529 the twocrowns signed a treaty which effectively put an end to the controversy concerning possession of the Moluccas. At first glance the treaty appeared tosignal defeat for the emperor. Charles gave up his claim to the islands inreturn for which the Portuguese crown had to pay him compensation of 35,000 gold ducats. Charles also negotiated a clause in the treaty whichallowed him to reclaim his right to the islands ifnew geographical evidenceemerged, upon return ofthe 35,000 ducats. A line ofdemarcation was to bedrawn 17 degrees east of the islands on a standard map which placed themfirmly within Portugal's sphere of influence. Any Castilians found infringing the new line could be punished by the Portuguese. Once more, it was the figure of the map that stood at the centre of thesettlement reached over the Moluccas, a contractual document bindingthe two sides in diplomatic agreement. The wording of the draft treatyfirst drawn up on 17 April emphasized the extent to which the standardization of the figure of the map was crucial in ascertaining the line ofdemarcation between the two sides and establishing diplomatic and commercial concord: In order that it may be known where the said line falls, a model map shall at oncebe made on which the said line shall be drawn in the manner aforesaid, and itwill thus be agreed to as a declaration of the point and place through which theline passes. This map shall be signed by the said lord Emperor and King of Castile, and by the said lord King of Portugal, and sealed with their seals. Inthe same manner, and in accordance with the said model map, the said line shallbe drawn on all the navigation charts whereby the subjects and natives of thekingdoms... shall navigate. In order to make the said model map, three personsshall be named by each of the said lord kings to make the said map upon oath, and they shall make the said line in conformity to what has been said above. When the map has thus been made, the said lord Emperor and King of Castileand the said lord and King of Portugal shall sign it with their names, and shallorder it to be sealed with the seals of their arms; and the said marine charts shallbe made from it as aforesaid, in order that the subjects and natives of the saidlord kings may navigate by them so long as the said lord King of Castile shallnot redeem and buy back the said right. 31 The treaty was thus a remarkable political document in which the ritualconstruction of the map, and the fantasy of its ability to implement aform of maritime policing (that was in reality unenforceable), stood as theobject through which the diplomatic transactions which carved up the Moluccas came to be ratified. Having been established as a'capital good'which entered the market - place alongside the spices and cloves it projected, the map now appeared in the more restricted arena of the politicaleconomy of diplomatic negotiation. It was this politically sensitive arenawhich appreciated the map as a type of visual contract. The projectedmap which was to emerge from the Treaty of Saragossa was to be purgedof the more openly acquisitive spirit of Pigafetta's sketch map, striving totranslate the commercial possibilities opened up by such mapmakers intothe political authority and power which accrued to the empires who laidclaim to the spice - producing islands of the Moluccas. However, it should be stressed that the maps produced both before andimmediately after the settlement reached at Saragossa were by no meansimpartial. The agreement ratified in April 1529, which fixed the line of demarcation 17 degrees east of the Moluccas, was an official resolution to anissue which the treaty itself nevertheless still conceded was a cartographiccompromise. The agreed text of the ratified treaty, in distinction to the initial draft, insisted that: In order to ascertain where the said line should be drawn, two charts of the sametenor will be made, conformable to the chart in the India House of Trade at Seville, and by which the fleets, vassals, and subjects of the said Emperor and King of Castile navigate. Within thirty days from the date of this contract twopersons shall be appointed by each side to examine the aforesaid chart andmake the two copies aforesaid conformable to it... This chart shall also designate the spot in which the said vassals of the said Emperor and King of Castileshall situate and locate Molucca, which during the time ofthis contract shall beregarded as situated in such place.3 The standardized map which was to emerge from this treaty clearly placedthe Moluccas under Portuguese jurisdiction. However, Charles'insistenceon including a clause which allowed him the opportunity to reclaim the Moluccas in the light of any future geographical information underlinedthe provisional nature of any line of territorial demarcation. The treatytherefore made it quite clear that under different political and commercialconditions the islands could easily be placed in a significantly differentgeographical position, such as the one which had been provided for themby the Castilian delegation. What shaped the contours of this projectedworld map, perhaps the most ambitiously planned one to be officiallysanctioned by both crowns, was not in fact geographical accuracy butcommercial and financial expediency. There can be no doubt that, despite ceding the rights to the Moluccas, Charles had obtained a highly satisfactory diplomatic and financial resultfrom the treaty. His original claim to the islands in the aftermath ofMagellan's voyage was tenuous to say the least. However, one of the mosteffective bargaining counters which he possessed throughout the negotiations was geographical knowledge, compellingly encapsulated in the mapsand charts which were repeatedly displayed and discussed throughout theprotracted diplomatic dispute. The awe and respect traditionally accordedto such knowledge was ruthlessly utilized by Charles and his diplomats inthe pursuit of diplomatic pre - eminence and financial gain. The treaty enhanced the status of maps and charts as objects valued for their relation tocommercial exploitation, as well as establishing geography as one of themost politically valuable domains of intellectual enquiry. The ability ofmaps to combine compelling geographical evidence ofthe location of contested territory with a capacity to concretize negotiated political settlementensured that the discipline of geography was to become enshrined withinthe intellectual and political life of the sixteenth - century world. Nowherewas this situation more in evidence than in the specific claims to geographical authority made by the specialists in attendance at the talks between Portugal and Castile throughout the 1520S. Cashing in on the Classics: The Geographical Debate over the Moluccas The central problem which confronted the Castilian and Portuguese negotiating teams in establishing their claims to geographical accuracy wasan inability to base their calculations on the position of the Moluccasupon a commonly accepted body of evidence. As was to be expectedunder such circumstances, the first authority to which the two sidesturned in an attempt to resolve their geographical differences was Ptolemy. However, even his texts, and in particular the Geographia, became the siteof controversy as the talks developed. This was because it soon becameclear that the calculations which Ptolemy developed in completing hiswork ironically favoured the Castilian, rather than the Portuguese, claimsto the Moluccas. According to Ptolemy the earth had a circumference of approximately 180,000 stadia (with ten stadia equalling 1.6 kilometres, or I mile).33 Although this estimation greatly reduced earlier calculations produced by Greek mathematicians such as Eratosthenes, it nevertheless still extendedthe actual figure of the circumference of the earth by one - sixth. Anotherconsequence of Ptolemy's calculations, which took their privileged geographical point of departure as the Mediterranean, was that the extent ofthe known world, the oikoumene, covered over 180 degrees from the Canary Islands to the borders of China. This produced an enormous overestimation of the eastward extension of Asia.34 The implications of thesecalculations within the context of the late fifteenth - and early sixteenthcentury European voyages ofdiscovery were profound. As a result Columbus had based his westward voyage towards what he perceived to be'theeast'on Ptolemy's arguments, believing that the eastward extension of Ptolemy's projected globe left an extremely short journey to reach Chinatravelling west.35 The most influential geographical manifestation of the ways in whichthese apparently academic issues impinged upon the thinking behindboth Portuguese and Castilian plans for maritime expansion was Martin Behaim's terrestrial globe, produced on the eve of Columbus'firstvoyage. The information contained on it has already been cited as a primary source adopted by Magellan to justify his westward voyage to the Moluccas. It was hardly surprising. Behaim's globe depicts the space between the west coast of Portugal and the east coast of China sailingwestwards as occupying a mere 130 degrees. The commonly agreedfigure has now been fixed at a far more substantial 230 degrees.36 Whilstincorporating the Portuguese voyages of discovery up to the point of Dias'rounding of the Cape of Good Hope in 1488, Behaim's globe stillretained a predominantly Ptolemaic representation of Asia, which depicted a completely erroneous peninsula, Sinus Magnus, to the east of the Malaysian peninsula, thus further overestimating the extent of the eastward trend of Asia. As editions of Ptolemy struggled to incorporate thediscoveries of Columbus to the west, whilst still reproducing the acceptedbelief in the eastward extension ofAsia, the as yet uncharted Pacific Oceanwas increasingly squeezed into a narrow band of cartographic space. By 1507 Martin Waldseemiiller's highly influential world map, in its attemptto reconcile the western discoveries with Ptolemy's depiction of Asia, leftthe Pacific a breadth of only 70 degrees.37 Such increasingly distortedrepresentations of the territories to the east of India emerged from thegrowing intellectual conflict between the academically enshrined authorityof the Ptolemaic text and the practical discoveries of the Portuguese geographers and pilots as they sailed deeper into the Indian Ocean throughoutthe early years of the sixteenth century. As a result, it became increasinglypossible to manipulate geographical and navigational data on the size andextent ofthe territories in question, particularly when substantial financialgain was at stake. In 1518, as news ofMagellan's imminent voyage to the politically sensitive Moluccas began to circulate throughout Seville, Martin Fernandez de Encisco, a former colonial administrator in Espanola, published his Sumade Geographie, an attempt to provide the first authoritative account ofworld geography to be published in Castile.38 Dedicated to Charles V, thetext borrowed freely from Portuguese navigating manuals, which had bythis time standardized their own information on sailing directions and distances. However, in one important instance Encisco's text departed fromits reliance on these manuals. The debate over the accurate length of adegree had preoccupied Portuguese geographers and pilots for manyyears, as they sought to establish an accurate measurement of longitude. After much disputation most commentators had agreed upon a degree asbeing 17Yz leagues. However, in the publication of his Suma Encisco departed from the manuals in only one respect: the calculation of thedegree. The political nature of his decision to alter its length is strikinglyborne out by the history of the printing of his text: A block was prepared for Encisco's book from the Portuguese original... thefigure 7 occurring in the value I7Yz leagues, which stood against the N - S and S N rhumbs, has been scraped out (not quite cleanly) and the figure 6 substituted. The rest ofthe diagram has been allowed to stand, in spite ofits inconsistency.39 In making this apparently minor alteration Encisco's calculations reducedthe Portuguese half - sphere to only 3,000 leagues instead of 3,150. Theresult was to position the contested Moluccas firmly within the Castilianhalf of the globe. Whilst Encisco's text did not explicitly foreground hissupport for Castile's claim to the islands, the importance of his apparentlyobjective mathematical calculation to the subsequent Castilian claim to the Moluccas was obvious. The politically calculated nature of Encisco's navigational mathematicsstressed the extent to which navigational and geographical speculationcould be of crucial importance in settling political claims not only to the Moluccas, but also to a range of commercially and territorially contestedlocations. This was not lost on Charles V and his advisers. In a remarkablestatement in his Conquista de las islas Malucas, Argensola stressed theimpact of this realization upon Charles in his attempt to lay claim to the Moluccas. Argensola noted that the emperor: Urg'd, that by Mathematical Demonstration, and the Judgement of Menlearned in that Faculty, it appear'd, that the Moluccos were within the Limitsof Castile, as were all others, as far as Malacca, and even beyond it. That itwas no easy Undertaking for Portugal to go about to disprove the Writings ofso many Cosmographers, and such able Mariners; and particularly the Opinion of Magellan, who was himself a Portuguese. And that in Case hemight be thought partial, because of his being disoblig'd in Portugal, that exception did not lie against Francis Serrano, who was also a Portuguese, and hadbeen favour'd and cherish'd. That to say the Sea Charts had been maliciouslycontriv'd, was a groundless Objection, and not probable. Besides that, in Relation to the Article of Possession, on which the Controversy depended, it wasonly requisite to stand by what was writ by, and receiv'd among Cosmographers. 4 Argensola's comments reveal the extent to which the manipulation ofclassical learning and geographical knowledge were central to the machinations which enabled Charles to emerge from the Moluccas dispute withsuch diplomatic and financial credit. Argensola's argument emphasizesthe extent to which the learned tradition of geographical enquiry wasestablished for political purposes as the ultimate arbiter of disputation. As far as both he and Charles were concerned, 'it was only requisite tostand by what was writ'. This was clearly a reference to the appreciationthat, ifthe dispute over the Moluccas was referred to the classical authorityofPtolemaic calculations, the Castilian claim to the Moluccas would actually be geographically justified. Argensola stressed that Portugal's claimcould only be upheld if it could'disprove the Writings of so many Cosmographers', indicative of the dilemma in which its cartographers foundthemselves. Since rounding the Cape in 1488, almost every navigationaldiscovery made by the Portuguese refuted some aspect of Ptolemy's Geographia. As such, learned geographical opinion, and particularlyopinion based primarily upon his calculations, was very much againsttheir claim to the Moluccas as lying within the Portuguese half of theglobe. It is not surprising to learn that, by the time the Castilian delegationmet at Badajoz - Elvas in April 1524, their geographical advisers had builtup a substantial claim to the islands based on the evidence of Ptolemy. Inhis opening remarks to the conference, the Castilian delegate Don Hernando Colon insisted in his response to Portuguese claims to the Moluccas that:... the aid of the old authors, Ptolemaeus and Plinius, is invoked to provemore accurately that the distance was shortened by the Portuguese.41 The joint statement of the learned geographical Castilian triumvirate of Tomas Duran, Sebastian Cabot and Juan Vespucci subsequently arguedthat:.. the description and figure of Ptolemaeus and the description and modelfound recently by those who came from the spice regions are alike... Therefore Zamatra, Malacca and the Malucos fall within our demarcation. 42 Even in the face ofthe more accurate geographical knowledge presented tothe conference by the Portuguese negotiating team, such intellectuallyauthoritative arguments ensured that they were unable to prove conclusively their possession of the Moluccas at Badajoz - Elvas, a situationwhich left Charles able to reach a financial settlement at Saragossa which, geographically speaking, he should not really have been able to negotiate sosuccessfully. However, as Argensola's comments testifY, Castilian attempts to ensurethat the Moluccas were positioned within their demarcated half of theglobe did not end with their manipulation ofthe tenets ofclassical geography. More contemporary geographical evidence was also graduallyamassed to support Castile's claim to the islands. As early as 1522 NUllo Garcia, the Castilian geographer who had drawn several maps for Magellan's expedition,43 acting on information provided by Elcano, completed amap of the voyage which placed the Moluccas firmly in the Castiliansphere (illus. 42). On this map the line of demarcation is shown runningthrough'Camatra' (Sumatra), to the west of the islands. Garcia's place atthe negotiating table at the initial conference at Badajoz - Elvas suggeststhat if not this very map, then maps based on its calculations were offeredin support ofCastile's claim to the Moluccas. However, the most consummate cartographic manuscript which seems to have been used by the Castilians did not emerge from Garcia, but from his colleague and officialcollaborator at Badajoz - Elvas, Diogo Ribeiro. Between his involvement in the original planning of Magellan's voyageand the diplomatic dispute over the Moluccas, Ribeiro had been busycompiling a series of world maps which were to have a profound effect onthe controversy. By 1527 he had produced the first of his comprehensivemanuscript maps of the world, and by 1529 he had completed a second, even more detailed, world map (illus. 43), on the eve of the successful conclusion of the dispute between Portugal and Castile in Saragossa. Bothhave been regarded by historians ofcartography as some ofthe most beautiful examples of the art of manuscript mapmaking.44 In line with theoutcome of the previous negotiations carried out at Badajoz - Elvas, Ribeiro's map of 1529 reflected the increasingly fine distinctions whichwere by this stage separating the two crowns. However, as can be seenfrom a closer scrutiny of its western section, Ribeiro proceeded to placethe Moluccas just within the Castilian sphere, a striking example of theextent to which he was aware of how sensitive was his placement of theislands. Ribeiro positioned them 1720 30'W of the Tordesillas line of 42 Nuno Garcia, chart of the Moluccas, c. 1522, vellum. Biblioteca del Re, Turin. 43 Diogo Ribeiro, world map, 1529, vellum. Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana. demarcation, just 7Y2 degrees inside the Castilian sphere.45 This broke withall previous geographical representations of the islands, which had repeatedly placed them in the eastern (Portuguese) hemisphere. For the very firsttime Ribeiro's map sensationally placed the Moluccas in the westernhemisphere. Overall the map offers an accurate representation of the Atlantic but Asia is slightly overextended, echoing Ptolemy, a conventionwhich Ribeiro would have known from his earlier cartographical studiescarried out in Portugal to be wholly inaccurate.46 Even more significantly, the breadth of the Pacific is greatly distorted on his map, with the distancebetween the westernmost point ofSouth America and the Moluccas comprising just 134 degrees, which was a substantial underestimation of theactual distance between the two points. 47 Ribeiro had skilfully managed to produce a map in line with the rapidlychanging requirements of the Castilian claim to the Moluccas, andmanipulated the enormous amount of highly sophisticated geographicalmaterial at his disposal, moving as he had between Lisbon and Seville. What he produced was not only a map which reflected the most up - todate geographical knowledge then available, but one which also emphatically claimed the righteousness of Castile's claim to the islands which itprized so greatly. Whilst it is not clear as to whether or not Ribeiro's mapwas presented in evidence at Saragossa in 1529, its monumental composition suggests that it formed the basis for those maps which were presented, and its continuing geographical influence stood as an abiding image of Charles'claim to the Moluccas, which could be quickly consulted if theemperor felt the need to reclaim his rights to the islands. The dispute between Castile and Portugal provided a unique opportunity for the establishment ofwhat could be called a'tournament ofvalue'48 between the geographers and their maps as they jockeyed for diplomaticand geographical supremacy. Figures like Ribeiro and Garcia shrewdlyworked within the political confines of the roles assigned to them in themidst of the controversy over the Moluccas. What they achieved was theenhancement of their own social status as professional geographers, whose cultural and political reputations were enhanced by their successfulparticipation in a tournament ofvalue which saw their products exhibitedas geographically instructive and politically persuasive cultural artefacts. What was even more significant in Ribeiro's case, was his ability to utilizescientific uncertainty to ensure that his maps could not simply be dismissed as propaganda. The inability to measure longitude objectivelyensured that the exact position of the Moluccas could not be settled scientifically for more than 200 years. Ribeiro therefore skilfully exploitedscientific uncertainty over the measurement, both to support Castile'sclaims to the islands and to insulate his own world map from charges ofwilful geographical distortion. Ribeiro's map could therefore only beattacked by maps which offered an even more comprehensive mix of political, commercial, intellectual and scientific authority. However, Ribeirohad established his own geographical reputation through exactly this ability to draw on a range of knowledges, particularly practical navigation andthe learned geography of classical authors like Ptolemy, in producing amap which managed to satisfy almost everybody. It satisfied seabornepilots, for its apparent hydrographic'accuracy'. It satisfied academic cosmographers, for its adherence to the classical geographers. It satisfied the Castilian negotiators, for its support of their claim to the Moluccas, and iteven satisfied the Portuguese for its acknowledgement oftheir own discoveries, in all but one crucial aspect - its positioning of the Moluccas. Operating beyond the routine parameters ofgeographical enquiry, Ribeiroseized the chance to display his map to a range of disparate social groupswhich would not have otherwise consulted his labours. His success ultimately lay in his ability to create the impression of scientific objectivityand hydrographic accuracy in a map which was deeply implicated in the Castilian claim to the Moluccas, employing the rhetoric of classical learning in the pursuit of specific political objectives which were themselvesultimately commercial. Like the'painted map'forwarded to the Austrianarchduke Ferdinand by Charles V in 1523, Ribeiro's map consummatelyparticipated in the trading of commercially useful territories betweencompeting crowns, inhabiting a space which fused territorial claims withcommercial ventures, a process which only served to enhance the statusof Ribeiro's own maps as themselves diplomatically and commerciallyvaluable objects. Ribeiro's state salary of3,000 maravedis must have been a small price topay for the advantage to Charles ofcashing in his claim to the Moluccas inreturn for 35,000 gold ducats. Professional geographical expertise camecheaply when such amounts were at stake. For the emperor the financialreturn on such a deal was clearly more attractive than establishing possession of the far - flung islands. The advantage of a quick return on the stakemade on them obviously seemed far more attractive to Charles and hiscreditors than the costly upkeep of administering the islands and thespice trade which emanated from their precious soil. By May 1529 confirmation of his successful negotiation to wrest such a large sum of moneyfrom the Portuguese crown had reached the ears of French merchants, for whom the injection ofa substantial amount ofmoney into Charles'coffers could only be good for business. On 6 May, Gaspar Contarini wrote tothe Venetian seigniory announcing that: The merchants of Lyons had news from Spain of the conclusion of the bargainbetween the Emperor and the King of Portugal about the navigation of the Indies, and that thereby the Emperor would obtain from 300,000 to 350,000 crowns.49 Viewed within this context, the geographical manipulations of Encisco, Garcia and Ribeiro should not be viewed as failures. Whilst they did notestablish Castilian possession over the Moluccas, it would seem that froma very early stage in negotiations this was never Charles'real aim in contesting the sovereignty of the islands. Instead the maps, charts andnavigational calculations of the geographical specialists attached to the Castilian negotiating teams were vital to securing his financial security inthe pursuit of imperial adventures nearer to home. The diplomatic and geographical contest between Castile and Portugalover the Moluccas has invariably been disregarded within both histories ofcartography and more general historical accounts of the politics of earlysixteenth - century Europe. Critical attention has tended to focus on thesignificance of the 1494 Treaty ofTordesillas in defining the geographicalscope of the imperial pretensions of the crowns of early modern Europe. However, the treaty only provisionally defined the outward expansion ofthe late fifteenth - century voyages. The Treaty of Saragossa was far moresignificant in literally completing the circle of the increasingly global pretensions of the crowns of Portugal and Castile by finally joining up theeastward and westward voyages of the early modem period to create thedefinitive global image which can be seen in Holbein's portrayal ofthe terrestrial globe in The Ambassadors. The fact that this global image was finallyestablished in the territories to the east of early modern Europe is symptomatic of the extentto which such eastern horizons have beenmarginalized in critical accounts of the period, which have focusedalmost exclusively on the'discovery'of the New World by Columbus. However, it was the search for the territories to the east which inspired notonly Columbus'first voyage in 1492, which resulted in the Treaty of Tordesillas, but also Magellan's circumnavigation of the globe in 1522, which ultimately resulted in the Treaty of Saragossa. In sailing west toreach the east, voyagers like Columbus and, even more significantly, Magellan exposed the limits of maps and charts which portrayed theearth upon a flat surface and ushered in a new era of global geography. The impact of this increasingly global geographical vision on mapmaking and the study of geography was momentous, and sparked off a wholenew industry of globemaking as merchants and princes demanded accessto the world picture that began to come into increasing focus in the aftermath ofMagellan's voyage and the negotiations over the Moluccas. In 1530 the renowned geographer Gemma Frisius began working on the creationofterrestrial globes, and in 1535 produced an engraved globe in Louvain,50 under the direct patronage of Charles V (illus. 44). It is worth invoking Frisius'comments on the significance of these terrestrial globes withinthe context ofthe Moluccas dispute, to emphasize the political importanceof this new global geography: The utility, the enjoyment and the pleasure of the mounted globe, which iscomposed with such skill, are hard to believe ifone has not tasted the sweetnessof the experience. 51 Charles clearly'tasted the sweetness'of Frisius'global geography: like Ribeiro's world map from which it drew much of its information, it placedthe Moluccas well within his half of the globe, offering further evidence of Charles'ability to make a renewed claim to the islands whenever he wished. The dispute over the Moluccas and the subsequent global developmentofearly modern geography ushered in a period of unprecedented geographical awareness in sixteenth - century Europe. This awareness presentedgeographers and mapmakers with an unprecedented level of social prestige and relative intellectual autonomy. In the late fifteenth centuryfigures like Berlinghieri and Behaim had struggled to establish their regional and global maps as images to which their patrons turned to definetheir political and commercial place in the early modern world. The increasing sophistication of the maps and globes of geographers like Ribeiro and Frisius allowed the study of geography to go one step further. When issues such as the measurement of a single degree made the difference between financial profit and potential commercial ruin, geographerswere given increasing licence to define the parameters of diplomatic disputation over territories and trade routes whose possession was vital tothe political authority of the empires of the early modern world. Increasingly employed as advisers and geographical specialists in the courts of 44 Gemma Frisius, terrestrial globe, engraved gores on a plaster base, c. 1535, Louvain. Globenmuseum der Osterreichisches Nationalbibliothek, Vienna. sixteenth - century Europe, geographers like Mercator and Ortelius eagerlyexploited their new - found freedom to create some of the most significantmaps, globes and atlases ofearly modern geography, and it is this development which concerns the final chapter in this book. As far as Bartholome de Argensola was concerned, looking back in 1609 at the diplomatic controversy over the Moluccas: The most bloody Theatre of continual Tragedies, was Ternate and all the Molucco's. There both Nations of Castile and Portugal decided their Quarrel bythe Sword, whilst their Kings in Europe only contended by Dint of Cunning, and Cosmography. 52 The debate over the Moluccas was not only a watershed in the politicalhistory of early modem Europe, but it was also a turning point in thepolitical apprehension of the importance of geography in defining thecontours of the early modern world. To produce and possess maps andglobes, as Charles V knew to his profit and Joao III to his chagrin, signifiednot only access to the possibility of laying claim to contested territorialpossession, but also imbued their owners with an air of commercialauthority. Both of these values were ultimately provided through recourseto the cunning of the cosmographer. 5 Plotting and Projecting: The GeographyofMercator and Ortelius With the settlement of the dispute over the Moluccas between the Castilian and Portuguese crowns at Saragossa in 1529, a definable shift began todevelop in the geographical conception ofthe early modem world. Magellan's circumnavigation of the globe and the subsequent diplomaticcontroversy over the Moluccas led to the establishment of a geographicaland political distinction between the territories of the so - called'Old World'to the east of mainland Europe and the territories of the'New World'to the west. As the Americas came into increasing geographicaldefinition, the concept of the Old World itself began to undergo a definable change. The older traditions based on Ptolemy and medieval T - O maps had established an abiding preoccupation with the territories to theeast, a preoccupation which continued to predominantly structure thegeography of the early sixteenth century as the Portuguese attempted tobring the commercial markets of the Old World under their jurisdiction. However, this concentration on a directional east still remained relativelyfree of subsequent cultural and political stereotypes of the dark, mysterious and exotic'Orient', which came to suffuse the political geography ofthe Enlightenment and beyond. However, it took a geographical and diplomatic dispute over the territories of the Old World to begin to circumscribe a directional east inrelation to its antithetical west, as the Moluccas dispute brought the Portuguese activities in the Old World right up against the increasinglyfocused territories of the Americas established by the Castilian advancesin the New World. The English diplomat Robert Thorne, who had closelyfollowed the dispute over the islands whilst living in Seville throughout the 1520S, vividly encapsulated this growing distinction between east and westin his report to Henry VIII, written in 1527: For these coastes and situation of the Ilands every of the Cosmographers andpilots of Portingall and Spayne doe set after their purpose. The Spaniardsmore towards the Orient, because they should appeare to appertaine to the Emperour [Charles V]: and the Portingalles more toward the Occident, for thatthey should fall within their jurisdiction. I Lacking a suitable language of directional east and west, Thorne adoptedthe terms'Orient'and'Occident'in an attempt to come to terms with theexpansion of the two crowns. As diplomats like Thorne struggled with the implications of this confusing, and still not as yet fully geographically defined, distinctionbetween Orient and Occident, it became incumbent upon the practisinggeographers and mapmakers of the period to try to produce a coherentrepresentation of the globe that distinguished east from west, and also toestablish where Europe as a geographical and political entity fitted into thischanging world picture. This chapter traces the responses to this problemproduced by two of the most renowned geographers in the history ofearlymodern cartography: Gerard Mercator and Abraham Ortelius. I want tosuggest that, working in the aftennath of the dispute over the Moluccas, it is no accident that both these geographers redefined both the geographical representation of the world, and also the status of geography in theearly modem period. Both have been rightly celebrated for their contributions to the establishment of geography as an intellectually and politicallyrespected discipline, establishing ways of creating and presenting geographical information which continue to influence the field ofgeography eventoday. Whilst Mercator's famous method ofprojecting the globe on a planestill remains the most widely used technique of representing the earth'ssurface, Ortelius'method of compiling and endlessly updating maps andgeographical information within the conveniently portable framework ofaprinted atlas also remains the standard by which contemporary geographers package and present their data. Due to the veneration which hasbeen accorded both men over the centuries for their solutions to the problems of geographical representation and distribution, the social andpolitical determinants which shaped their products have often been overlooked in an attempt to establish their intellectual achievements as beingthose of disinterested scholars, objectively pursuing the establishment ofgeography as a scientifically rigorous intellectual discipline. However, this response to Mercator and Ortelius fails to appreciate the extent towhich their output was produced within the context of the increasinglycommercial and political nature ofgeography and mapmaking in the aftermath of the Moluccas dispute. It was the specific peculiarities of thispolitical dispute, and the geographical controversy which it produced, which to a great extent established the conditions under which Mercatorand Ortelius created their most significant maps, globes and atlases fromthe I530S to the end of the sixteenth century. This is not to suggest thattheir output completely sacrificed geographical accuracy in the face ofpolitical pressure. Instead, what is most revealing in the work ofboth geographers is the ways in which they consistently produced politicallysensitive but geographically comprehensive maps and globes. Their products managed to satisfy both their political patrons and the demands ofthe market - place, whilst also magnifying the social status offirst Mercatorand then Ortelius as revered but also worldly geographical specialists, whowere capable ofunifying a tangle ofdisparate and often contradictory geographical observations, reports and travel accounts into aestheticallymagnificent and intellectually comprehensive maps and atlases, whichmoved towards establishing a standard representation of the earlymodern world. Printing and Profiting: The Marketing ofPrinted Geography One ofthe most significant aspects ofthe geography ofboth Mercator and Ortelius was the extent to which they skilfully adapted the growingmedium of print to market their work. The diffusion of printing towardsthe end of the fifteenth century had already established Ptolemy's Geographia as one of the most influential geographical texts available to theprinces, diplomats, scholars and merchants of the period. As has alreadybeen seen, geographers and editors like Berlinghieri were quick to appreciate the ability of the printing press to accurately and rapidly disseminate astandard representation ofthe world. However, by the 1520S the improvedtechniques of printing allowed for an even greater diversification ofprinted geographical texts, which could be distributed on an even greaterscale. Commercial centres throughout northern Europe such as Antwerp, Brussels, Strasbourg, Nuremberg and Augsburg provided the financialand material contexts for presses which located themselves at the crossroads of learning and commerce, the two most important ingredients inthe world of printing. The result was an explosion of material on issues asdisparate as religion, education, science, travel, philosophy, literature and, of course, geography. Although the impact of print was invariably limitedto literate communities who were able to afford printed texts, the sheernumber of both written and visual books which came off the presses ofnorthern Europe in the early decades of the sixteenth century indicatesthe extent to which the influence of print culture extended well beyondthe rich and the learned. The printing of maps and books on geographywas symptomatic of this dispersal of print throughout sixteenth - century European culture. The maps and geographical books which came off the presses of Strasthe beginning of the sixteenth century provide just onebourg atparticularly well - documented example of the spectacular growth inprinted mapmaking during this period. The city was home to some ofthe most innovative editors and printers working in the field of geography. Between 1500 and 1520 its presses produced no less than seventeen worksspecifically concerned with geography.2 In 1507 one ofthe most influentialprinters in the city, Johannes Griininger, published an enormous woodcut, on twelve sheets, of Martin Waldseemiiller's famous Universaliscosmographia secundum Ptholomaei traditionem et Americi Vespucii aliorumquelustrationes (A Map ofthe World According to the Tradition ofPtolemy and the Voyages ofAmericus Vespucci and Others; illus. 27). This was the first map tounite the disparate collection of islands which had been thought to consti - tute the New World into a single landmass, named'America'. Theproduction of such maps, uniting printed excellence with up - to - theminute information on the new discoveries, established Strasbourg as amajor centre of map printing. However, what was significant about thetechnology which produced maps of the standard ofWaldseemiiller's wasnot just the precision of the maps, but their sheer number. Griiningerprinted 1,000 copies of Waldseemiiller's wall map which, consideringthat it was composed of twelve separate sheets, meant a print run of 12,000 separate sheets. He went on to print a series of maps designed by Waldseemiiller in 1522 and 1525. Evidence suggests that by 1525 Griininger had printed no fewer than 3,500 wall maps composed on separatesheets, involving over 98,000 large folio sheets, a staggering investment oftime, skill and resources in the relatively novel art of map printing.3 As ashrewd businessman with contacts throughout the commercial world ofsixteenth - century Strasbourg, Griininger would not have made such aninvestment in Waldseemiiller's work without a firm conviction that apublic existed to purchase such beautiful and expensively produced maps. The ability of printing like Griininger's to exactly reproduce comprehensive maps such as Waldseemiiller's and distribute them on a massscale to the book (and map) buying public not only expanded a generalawareness of the cultural significance of maps, but also led to significantchanges in the conditions under which they came to be produced. Thepart played by printing in reproducing the detailed manuscript mapsdrawn up by geographers like Berlinghieri and Ribeiro established a perceptible distance between the geographer and his patron. Whilst Waldseemiiller acted as the official geographer to the court of Rene II, Duke of Lorraine, his involvement with Griininger's press in Strasbourgallowed him a degree of relative intellectual autonomy in the supervisionofhis work that was not often accorded to scribal scholars and geographers, who invariably undertook their commissions under the very roof of theirparticular patron. What increasingly defined the intellectual production ofscholars and geographers like Waldseemiiller was not the contacts established within a closely knit group operating under the patronage of asingle figure, but the so - called'republic of letters', the diffuse collectionof scholars, printers and travellers scattered across the states of earlymodern Europe. The exchange of information and knowledge within thisinformal republic allowed for a growing diversification of geographicalrepresentation, which was aimed not only at a specific patron, but also atan increasingly anonymous book - buying public. As a result, patrons beganto associate themselves with particularly respected geographers, ratherthan vice versa, as had been the case with Berlinghieri, who had repeatedlyattempted to associate his 1482 Geographia with a politically influentialpatron. It was under these changing conditions of production and circulation that both Mercator and Ortelius fashioned their own highlydistinctive maps, globes and atlases. The early career of Gerard Mercator (illus. 45) is symptomatic of thechanges which were taking place within the field of printed geography bythe 1530S, and is worth considering briefly to examine the ways in which hemediated between the political requirements of his cartographic productsand the need to market his work skilfully within the context of an increasingly discerning map - buying public. After studying at the University of Louvain, Mercator, like many sixteenth - century geographers, appliedhimself to the study of the specific technical skills required to produceprinted maps and globes. By 1535 he had established himself as a copperengraver of repute, and was responsible for engraving the gores for Gemma Frisius'terrestrial globe, which was produced in the same year. Yet Frisius'globe, as has been seen, was itselfcaught up in the continuingcontroversy over the placement of the Moluccas. Having positioned theislands within the Castilian half of the globe, it laid claim to comprehensive knowledge of the terrestrial globe whilst also aligning itself politicallywith the interests of its patron, none other than Charles V himself. Inmany ways Frisius'globe was an even more enduring geographicalsymbol of Charles'claim to the Moluccas than Ribeiro's world map of 1529 as, unlike Ribeiro's map, this globe, made from printed gores engraved by Mercator, could be repeatedly reproduced to underline Charles'claim to the spice islands, a claim which was further strengthenedthrough its representation within the powerful medium of print. In February 1536 Charles issued a privilege, which gave Frisius and the globe'sprinter, Gaspard van der Hayden, a monopoly on reproducing the printedimage of the globe. The privilege is worth quoting in full as an example ofthe ways in which printers and geographers came to exercise increasingcommercial and representational control over their politically sensitivegeographical products: Inasmuch as our loyal Subjects, the Mathematician Gemma Phrisius and Gaspar a Myrica [Gaspard van der Hayden], do purpose to issue for the general 45 Portrait of Gerard Mercator, engraving in his Atlas sive Cosmographicae Meditationes de Fabrica Mundi et Fabn'cati Figura, 1595. British Library, London. use of those interested, a globe or sphere, enlarged, augmented and more splendid than that previously issued (together with a Celestial Globe), with theaddition of countries and islands recently discovered; And inasmuch as We are favourably disposed to this praiseworthy scheme oftheirs by which they endeavour, not only to elucidate Mathematics, revive thememory of ancient kingdoms and conditions, and present them to the peopleof our age but also to hand down to future centuries the memory of our ownage and our own Kingdom, which (by the grace of God) encompasses many islands and territories practically unknown to any previous century, and not a fewofwhich are fortunately being imbued with the Christian religion; In full knowledge of the facts, We now, by virtue of the document, prohibit andforbid all printers, and booksellers, and all heads, officials or employees of thebook - trade, as well as all persons, subjects of ours and of the Holy Roman Empire, whatever the name they bear, and whatever rank, privilege or positionthey may hold, to duplicate such globes or spheres, or the Introductions and Forewards explaining them, under whatever title they be issued, or may beissued, by the said Gemma and Gaspar jointly or separately, within the nextfour years following upon the drawing - up of the present document, or otherwise to cause to have made, or cut in metal or other material, or to introduce, sale, or hawk, publicly or privately, globes or introductions made or cut elsewhere, in similar or other form, without the consent of the said Phrisius and Gaspar; Upon pain ofOur severe displeasure, and a fine of IO marks in pure silver, to bedevoted to Our fiscal requirements, besides the forfeiture of the work or bookscut, or made and which the said Gemma and Myrica, or their agents, may beentitled to confiscate and use, wherever they be found, with the aid of theauthorities or at their own discretion, for whatever purposes they may determine. 4 What is so significant about the privilege is the extent to which it protectsthe rights of the producers of the globe on the open market, rather thanrestricting the reproduction of the globe according to the wishes of itspatron, Charles V. Any unauthorized reproduction, once sold on theopen market to anyone with sufficient means to purchase it, wouldobviously minimize any financial profit which Frisius and van der Hayden would reap from sales of their unique globe. Charles was undoubtedly'favourably disposed to this praiseworthy scheme'; not only didthe globe reassert his claim to the Moluccas, but it also flew the emperor'sflag over his recent conquest of Tunis in North Africa, which Charles hadtaken from the Ottomans in 1535. Yet the privilege which Frisius and vander Hayden negotiated in return for such a geographically flattering portrait of the scope of Charles'territorial possessions gave the geographerand printer sole rights to the reproduction of their globe, in an attemptnot only to signify its geographical importance as a masterful example ofglobemaking, but also to maximize its commercial profitability in an increasingly competitive open market. Evidence of the strategies which Frisius and van der Hayden adopted inthe marketing oftheir terrestrial globe is vividly encapsulated in one ofthelegends which adorns its surface: Gemma Frisius, doctor and mathematician, described this work from variousobservations made by geographers and gave it this form; Gerard Mercator of Rupelmonde engraved it with Gaspard van der Heyden, from whom the work, a product of extraordinary cost and no less effort, may be purchased.5 The legend, presumably composed by Frisius, stresses the financial valueof the globe in terms of both the intellectual labour which went into itsproduction and the material cost involved in putting together such a complex object. As the master copper - engraver whose plates went to van der Hayden's printing press after their approval by Frisius, Mercator appearsto have been fully aware of the ways in which both his teacher Frisius andhis printer van der Hayden maximized the commercial and intellectualsignificance of their globe whilst also creating a geographical artefactwhich gave considerable pleasure to its patron. Mercator's ensuing geographical career suggests that he quickly learnedfrom the experience ofworking with Frisius and van der Hayden. His cartographic output consistently united political caution and technicalbrilliance with an eye to the expanding commercial market in maps andglobes. In keeping with the system of patronage which had served him sowell whilst working with Frisius, Mercator went on to engrave a map of Flanders in 1540, which he dedicated to Charles V.6 His subsequent workbrought him in touch with some of the most influential decision - makersin Charles'empire as he created several mathematical and cartographicalinstruments which he dedicated to Nicholas Perrenot de Granvelle, amember of Charles'privy council and one of the emperor's closest advisers.7 By the early 1540S Mercator was astutely using his political contactsand technical expertise to fashion an identity for himselfas one ofthe mostrespected geographers of the day. In 1541, in direct imitation of his formerteacher Frisius, he issued his own printed terrestrial globe, the first toappear under his name alone (illus. 46). In the words of his self - appointedbiographer Walter Ghim, Mayor ofDuisburg, writing in 1595, Mercator: Dedicated it [the globe] to a distinguished nobleman, M. Nicholas Perrenot de Granvelle, by far the most eminent ofthe Privy Council ofthe Emperor Charlesv. Meanwhile, through the recommendation of this gentleman, he came to thenotice ofthe said Emperor, and he made for his Majesty a large number of scientific instruments ofexquisite workmanship.8 Like Frisius, Mercator took care to ensure that his globe obtained animperial privilege from Charles forbidding its unauthorized reproduction, along similar lines to the one granted to Frisius just five years earlier. In his description of the construction of this, his first globe printed andmarketed under his own name, Mercator carefully weighed up not only thegeographical rationale for producing it, but also the financial reasonswhich underpinned his decision to undertake the creation of such a timeconsuming artefact. In a letter to Granvelle's son Antoine, he explained hisreasons for making the globe: As I had anticipated before I began work, I have concentrated my attention onthe'spherica geographia'so as to have a shield for my domestic financial obligations. Consequently, I began to devote spare hours to comparing the oldgeography with the new. The more carefully I examine, the more errors I findin which we are enmeshed. It seems particularly erroneous to take Malacca forthe Aurea Chersonesus {the'Golden Peninsula'} of Antiquity; moreover, theymake Taprobana into an area very close to Malacca and only separated from itby a relatively narrow strait; Ptolemy placed it about 30 degrees from the greatcircle away from China. And yet, our hydrographers have placed Taprobana notfurther away from Cape Similla, now Cumari [Cape Comorin] than Ptolemydid. They consider the length of India from west to east to be half that of what Ptolemy suggested, and yet, Strabo accepted Ptolemy's length, based on solidgrounds. When we, blinded in this way, attempted to harmonise the irresolvabledifference between the old and the new, we denounced both the ancient and themore recent descriptions; in addition, by means of small adjustments, weundermined the current symmetry of the coasts as well as the findings the ancient geographers had achieved through great effort. How deceived we are in our 46 Gerard Mercator, terrestrial globe, engraved gores on aplaster base, 154!. Kultur - und Stadthistorisches Museum, Duisburg. own conception of the Far East will be sufficiently clear to anyone who attentively reads Marco Polo the Venetian. For this reason, in the hope that ourconclusions of this type will fall upon fertile ground with those who are interested, I have decided to publish a terrestrial globe. Secretary Morillon and Adrianus Amerocius are extremely pleased with this decision and encourageits being carried out.9 Mercator's comments are a fascinating insight into the commercial andgeographical considerations which preoccupied sixteenth - century geographers working in the medium of print. It appears to have been morefinancially lucrative for him to produce the type of globe which, in theaftermath of the Moluccas dispute, was in great demand. Before embarking on any grand geographical project, Mercator had to ensure that hislabours would provide him with a large enough financial reward to'shield'him from'domestic financial obligations'. Significantly, he notedthat the project had already received the political support of the emperor'spolitical advisers, Granvelle and Morillon both being'extremely pleased'with his globe. For Mercator, it was clearly more commercially viable toproduce a globe which had received the sanction of the crown than toembark on a detailed series of printed maps whose commercial successcould in no way be guaranteed. Yet even more tellingly, in his discussionof the geographical innovations which his globe would offer, he coveredexactly the same ground as that pursued by the pilots and geographersinvolved in the Moluccas dispute fifteen years earlier. His apparentlyrespectful attempt to compare'the old geography with the new', whichinvolved a comparative analysis of Ptolemy's geographical accounts with'our hydrographers', was in fact a judicious intervention within the termsof the controversy over the Moluccas and their position in relation to theolder Ptolemaic calculations. The main points of disputation surroundedthe erroneous positioning of the Portuguese - held Malacca, the placementof Taprobana (modem Sri Lanka) too far to the east, and the relative'length of India from west to east'. All of these disputes were, as has beenpointed out, central to the political dispute over the Moluccas. Mercator's commercially and politically sensitive response to the controversy over the size and extent of the Ptolemaic Old World alsoemphasizes the way in which he carefully fashioned his own intellectualidentity as an impartial scholar engaging in an academic inquiry'to harmonise the irresolvable difference between the old and the new'geographical positions, which had been so clearly exposed in the disputeover the Moluccas. Steeping himself in the writings of Strabo and Ptolemy, Mercator was nevertheless astute enough to combine such learning with carefully judged interventions into more contemporary politicalissues, without appearing to take sides. The new market in printed mapsand globes not only desired a geography imbued with the classical tradition of Ptolemy and Strabo, but it also required a level of ostensibleimpartiality in the geographical disagreements which had characterizedthe diplomatic disputes between Castile and Portugal regarding overseasterritories since the Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494. The manuscript mapsof Ribeiro and Garcia had been produced for a specific political momentin time, and despite their success were not destined for acceptance into thepantheon of a geographical discipline which was increasingly wrappingitself in the mantle of a purportedly scientific objectivity. Mercator's ability to fashion an intellectual identity characterized by the pursuit ofsupposedly objective learning ensured that he retained the aura ofa disinterested geographical savant, whilst simultaneously ensuring the retentionofa level of imperial patronage and commercial success which was to ultimately secure his future economic independence. Mercator's ability to combine geographical skill with an astute management of the commercial and political implications of his work quicklybegan to reap intellectual and financial rewards, as his products becamesome of the most sought after in sixteenth - century Europe. In 1568 the Spanish diplomat Benito Arias Montano wrote to his superiors in Spain, informing them that the globes ofboth Frisius and Mercator could be purchased from the printing houses of Antwerp. The Frisius globe of 1535 could be purchased for eight escudos, whilst Mercator's 1541 globe couldbe bought for twelve escudos. Montano's superiors subsequently orderedhim to buy the latter, an indication ofthe reputation that Mercator's globeswere beginning to attract by the late 1560s.10 From the 1550S Mercator'ssales were managed by one ofAntwerp's most respected printers, Christopher Plantin. Between 1558 and 1576 Plantin's business ledgers record thathe sold no fewer than 868 copies ofMercator's wall map ofEurope, whichhad been printed in 1554. I I Again, in creating this particular map Mercatortook care to dedicate it to his imperial patron, Antoine Perrenot.12 Hisgrowing reputation had earlier brought him into contact with Charles V himself, and in 1552 Mercator had: Constructed by order ofthe Emperor two small globes, one ofpurest crystal andone of wood. On the former, the planets and the more important constellationswere engraved with a diamond and inlaid with shining gold; the latter, whichwas no bigger than the little ball with which boys play in a circle, depicted theworld, in so far as its small size permitted, in exact detail. These, with otherscientific instruments, he presented to the Emperor at Brussels. 13 This apparently rather whimsical commission only further strengthenedthe status of geography as a discipline which provided emperors andprinces with tangible evidence of their access to an understanding of notonly the earth, but also the stars. Mercator elegantly expressed his abilityto reveal the arcane mysteries ofthe cosmos in the production ofthe celestial globe, whilst also emphasizing his ability to operate at the more worldlyand political level of the terrestrial globe. The crystal, gold and diamondswhich made up Mercator's celestial globe were only further evidence oftheriches which could be extracted from the distant places represented on theterrestrial globe, territories which had been made accessible by geographers like Ribeiro and Garcia. Mercator appears to have been happy tocash in on this situation as a way of increasing his esteem at Charles'court, whilst also proceeding to work on even more ambitious geographical projects. Polt\"tics and Projections: Mercator's 'Map ofthe World'By the early 1560s commissions such as those undertaken for Charles V allowed Mercator the financial security and relative intellectual freedomto embark upon an even more grandiose project than the terrestrial globewhich he had produced in 1541. The problem which he undertook to resolve was one which had troubled sailors for decades. Navigators hadalways been aware of the unfeasibility ofusing terrestrial globes to providesuitable explanations ofhow to navigate simply and effectively across openseas on long - distance voyages. Whilst globes such as those produced by Frisius and Mercator struggled over the geographical implications ofuniting the Occident with the Orient in the aftermath of Magellan's voyage, their size and bulk prevented their effective utilization at sea. Althoughthey do appear to have been part ofthe esoteric geographical paraphernaliataken on overseas expeditions, plotting a course across a spherical globewas simply not viable. Sailors required rutters (written sailing instructions) and, increasingly, flat charts across which they could accurately and confidently project their oceanic progress day by day. However, as the Portuguese had known for decades, flat portolan chartsof the type used by sailors in the Mediterranean were wildly inaccuratewhen faced with long - distance voyages as they failed to allow for the natural curvature of the earth. Tracing a line between two points on theearth's surface involved taking this curve into account. Lines of bearingon portolan charts were unable to solve this mathematical conundrum, and as a result traditional sailing along an apparently straight line between A and B would consistently lead pilots slowly off - course, as they failed toallow for the fact that the line ofbearing curved gradually due to the spherical nature of the earth. The further the distance travelled, and the longerthe line ofbearing pursued, the more ships sailed further off - course. Geographers therefore went in search of a geographical projection whichwould literally square the circle by portraying the sphericity of the globeon a flat surface. This would in theory allow pilots to plot their coursesacross the surface of a flat map along a straight line of constant bearingwhich, as the map took into account the curvature of the earth, wouldenable them to reach their appointed destination without sailing offcourse. By the middle of the sixteenth century such a method of navigating was becoming increasingly necessary to keep pace with the growingintensity and nature of long - distance travel. Sailing into the relative unknown and discovering previously uncharted land no longer motivatedlong - distance seaborne travel. The commercial ethos which surroundedboth the Portuguese and Castilian ventures into the waters of the Indianand Pacific Oceans ensured that it was necessary to be able to navigaterapidly and accurately between a specified point of departure and a specified point of arrival. It became increasingly imperative for empires andmerchant - financiers investing in long - distance enterprises to ensure thatexpensively outfitted expeditions reached their appointed destinationsquickly and returned as soon as possible to maximize the financial profitsfrom their precious cargoes. Bound up with such commercial concernswere political considerations which increasingly restricted the arbitrarymovement of ships across the open seas. The Treaty of Saragossa hadnominally circumscribed the geographical limits within which shippingcould move. The diplomatic repercussions ofany significant disclosure ofmaritime transgressions of these lines of demarcation, however innocent, were nevertheless potentially explosive. 47 Gerard Mercator, world map, copperplate engraving, Louvain, 1538. New York Public Library. Mercator had already experimented with the problem of mapping theglobe on a plane surface in 1538, when he published a world map on aheart - shaped projection (illus. 47). However, this was quite clearly oflittleuse to navigators and pilots. It was in response to this problem that hebegan work on a new world map on a plane surface which would accountfor the curvature of the globe, and which would allow pilots to chart astraight line of navigational bearing, free from the distortions of the olderportolan charts. After many years working on this new map and the complex mathematical projection required to emplot the spherical coordinatesof the earth's surface onto a flat map, Mercator published his now famous Nova et aucta orbis terrae descriptio ad usum navigatium emendate accomodata (illus. 48). The intellectual significance of this new world map was underlined by the care which Mercator again took in the marketing of the newprojection. He was granted two royal privileges protecting his rights overreproduction of the map, one from Charles V to cover its publication andcirculation in the German states for fourteen years, and one from Charles'son Philip II which forbade its unauthorized reproduction for ten yearsthroughout the Netherlands. I4 The whole map was dedicated to Mercator's patron, 'the most illustrious and clement Prince and Lord William, Duke of Julich, of Cleves and of Berg'. [5 The care which Mercator took 48 Gerard Mercator, world map, copperplate engraving, Duisburg, 1569. Offentliche Bibliothekder Universitat Basel. over the rights to its production and distribution was indicative of the importance he attached to a map which was to revolutionize not onlysixteenth - century geography, but ultimately the future development ofmodern western cartography. In his introductory notes to the map, Mercator outlined its ambitiousnature, reiterating its importance in finally encompassing the global complexity of the earth's surface into a single map represented on a planesurface. He claimed that his intention was: To spread on a plane the surface ofthe sphere in such a way that the positions ofplaces shall correspond on all sides with each other both in so far as true direction and distance are concerned and as concerns correctlongitudes andlatitudes; then, that the forms be retained, so far as is possible, such as theyappear on the sphere. 16 The difficulty ofMercator's project lay in constructing a plane representation which depicted the meridians as parallel to each other rather than, asis the case with the true representation of the globe, converging on thenorth and south poles. If this could be achieved, then it would be possibleto chart across its surface a line ofconstant bearing that was straight, ratherthan a spiral as would be the case when trying to trace it on a globe. Theimportance of Mercator's innovation in terms of accurate navigationalpractice and commercial profit was quite clear. Instead of taking awkwardand imprecise bearings on board ship across the surface ofa globe or a portolan chart, his new projection allowed for a line of bearing to be drawnaccurately across the surface of a plane map, explicitly foregrounding, asits title suggests, its usefulness to the art of navigation. With pilots and navigators in mind, Mercator went on to outline themathematical procedure which allowed him to emplot an accurate grid ofstraight lines across his map, whilst also retaining the relative geographicalaccuracy of the topography of the globe. In his notes to the map, Mercatorexplained that this new projection involved having: Progressively increased the degrees of latitude towards each pole in proportionto the lengthening of the parallels with reference to the equator; thanks to thisdevice we have obtained that, however two, three or even more than three, placesbe inserted, provided that of these four quantities: difference of longitude, difference of latitude, distance and direction, any two be observed for each placeassociated with another, all will be correct in the association of anyone placewith any other place whatsoever and no trace will anywhere be found of any ofthose errors which must necessarily be encountered on the ordinary charts ofshipmasters, errors ofall sorts. 17 This lengthening of the degrees of latitude enabled the globe to be flattened out whilst still allowing for accurate straight lines of navigationalbearing to be drawn across the surface ofthe new map. However, in devel - oping such a groundbreaking geographical projection, Mercator's calculations were also clearly informed by political considerations as to whichareas were to be represented with the highest degree of topographical accuracy. Whilst the projection allowed for detailed and highly accuratedepictions of the territories radiating outwards from the equator, those inhigher latitudes became increasingly distorted, to the point at which, ascan be seen on the map, the northern and southern polar lands could nolonger be represented with any semblance of geographical accuracy, asthey stretch into infinity. However, this distortion of a north - south axis, at the expense of a more comprehensive depiction of an east - west axis, was clearly not one which unduly affected the diplomatic and commercialpreoccupations of Charles V's empire by the late 1550s. By this time the Habsburg empire had been split into its respective German and Spanishdominions, and the reach of the Habsburgs stretched right round theglobe, from the Americas to the Philippines. The establishment of suchan extensive global commercial network in the aftermath of the disputeover the Moluccas came to be reflected in not only the geographical representation but also the mathematical calculations which went to make up Mercator's new map. This network stretched from Portuguese control ofmerchandise flowing back into northern Europe from Southeast Asia andthe Indian Ocean in the east, to the Habsburg involvement in the Americasand the Pacific Ocean to the west. Mercator's map emphasizes that thiseast - west axis was to be the abiding focus of the sixteenth - century worldpicture, to the exclusion of a north - south vision of the world which nolonger held any territorial or commercial interest for either the growing Habsburg or the waning Portuguese empires. Mercator conceded that his map was primarily concerned with the eastern and western dominions of the Portuguese and Spanish empires, as henotes in his commentary: The second object at which we aimed was to represent the positions and thedimensions ofthe lands, as well as the distances ofplaces, as much in conformitywith very truth as it is possible so to do. To this we have given the greatest care, first by comparing the charts of the Castilians and of the Portuguese with eachother, then by comparing them with the greater number of records of voyagesboth printed and in manuscript. It is from an equitable conciliation of all thesedocuments that the dimensions and situations of the land are given here asexactly as possible. I8 The'equitable conciliation'which Mercator's map established emergedfrom direct consultation of Castilian and Portuguese maps, which hadbeen predominantly concerned in previous years with establishing theposition of the Moluccas Islands. Whilst this new map avoided takingany explicit political position in relation to this debate, it neverthelessreproduced the increasingly bifurcated distinction between the Spanishdominated west and the Portuguese - dominated east which began to materialize with increasing political and geographical clarity in the aftermath ofthe Moluccas dispute. Mercator's projection has been accused of constituting a defining act ofEurocentrism, in its portrayal of an overweeninglyprominent Europe placed in the midst of a world picture which scalesdown the extent of the landmasses of America, Africa and Asia. Whilstthe nature of the projection did indeed lead to a relative reduction in thesize of these continents in relation to Europe, its conceptual orientation isarguably more complex than simply instating the centrality of Europe. More compellingly, Mercator's world map established a distinctionbetween a geopolitical east and west which reflected their growing polarization in line with the territorial and commercialinterests of thesixteenth - century imperial powers. Rather than working outwards fromthe geographically and politically privileged space of Europe, it orientedits appearance around the continents to the east and west which wereclaimed to be under the putative control of the competing Europeanempires. It was no longer necessary for a geographer like Mercator tomake politically expedient decisions in his geographical calculations inorder to satisfy the Habsburg authorities who protected the commercialrights to his maps. As the Spanish empire continued to concentrate itscommercial interests in the Americas to the west ofEurope, these authorities were presumably quite happy to appreciate a revolutionary world mapwhich defined their sphere of interest in distinct geographical oppositionto those of the Portuguese in the east. The gradual waning of Portuguese authority in Southeast Asia towardsthe end of the sixteenth century led to the increasing political and commercial predominance of the so - called'Atlantic World'in Europeanaffairs, which itself led to the subsequent political marginalization of theterritories to the east of Europe. It was this bifurcation between east andwest which I would argue created the conditions for the discursive deployment of the idea of the'Orient'within European travel accounts andgeographical discourse of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, which implicitly framed descriptions ofan exotic, indolent and mysterious'East'in relation to a dynamic and enlightened'West'.I9 These accountsincreasingly took as their ontological and geographical centre not the Mediterranean, but the Atlantic. This shift in the geographical and political imagination ofthe early modern world became enshrined in Mercator'smap, which gradually became the model from which all subsequent worldmaps took their lead. Although the enormity of its scale ensured that it wasin fact useless for navigation, the principles of Mercator's projection wereutilized in regional maps and charts drawn on a smaller scale to allow foraccurate navigation over large distances. Due to this fact alone, the shapeof the world defined by Mercator remained the standard which all othersimitated. Rather than establishing the beginning ofearly modem cartography, inmany ways Mercator's map signalled its end. Mercator had produced aworld map which would appear recognizably'modem'to any student ofgeography today. It had emerged from the diplomatic and territorial disputes between the Castilian and Portuguese crowns which stretched backas far as the Treaty ofTordesillas in 1494, and it ultimately participated inthe political and commercial triumphs of the westward - looking Habsburgempire as it consolidated its power base in Spain under Charles'son, Philip II. Mercator's map presented the Spanish - dominated territories inthe west on an equal footing with the Portuguese ones to the east whichhad been the focal point of the cultural, commercial and diplomaticencounters of states such as Venice, Portugal and the Ottoman dominionsfor centuries. In redefining the geographical and political concept ofthe'West'as a commercially powerful, territorially meaningful place, itushered in not only the predominance of the Atlantic World, but consequently the marginalization of what has come to be defined as the'East', or the'Orient'. As the Spanish - based empire of Philip increasinglyasserted its ascendancy over the waning power of the Portuguese, it wasthis Atlantic World, so central to Mercator's map, which was to claim economic, political and cultural supremacy over its geographical and culturalantithesis, the east. Rather than being seen as a product of the monolithicinstitution of Eurocentrism, Mercator's map should therefore be examined as a carefully negotiated geographical artefact, which created theconditions for the subsequent derogation of the territories of the Old World that had been so central to the commercial, diplomatic and geographical transactions which had characterized the shape of the early modernworld since at least the early fifteenth century. Emerging from the diplomatic and geographical disputations which had arisen concerning theterritories to the east of Europe, it could be viewed as the first map to signify, geographically and politically, the'triumph of the west', partly as aresult of its comprehensive ability to both define and distinguish this concept of the west from its increasingly demonized antithesis: the east. A Library Without Walls: Ortelius'Theatrum Orbis Terrarum If Mercator was responsible for mobilizing an image of the world profoundly affected by the growing global aspirations of the House of Habsburg, then it was his equally famous scholarly contemporary Abraham Ortelius who spent much of his geographical and commercial careermarketing his own version of this world picture. Mercator may have beenthe self - styled Ptolemy ofsixteenth - century geography, but it was Orteliuswho set out self - consciously to portray himself as its'capable shopkeeper'.20 Like Mercator, his initial involvement in geography was in the commercial production and distribution of cartographical artefacts, rather than inthe rarefied field of scholarly geographical enquiry. In 1558 Ortelius, anative ofAntwerp, is recorded as having purchased maps from Mercator'spublisher Plantin, which he subsequently coloured and resold at a profit. This was a commercial aspect of the map trade which Ortelius came todominate in subsequent years, and from where he eventually establishedenough influence to launch a career as a cartographer in his own right. Itseems fitting that, considering their mutual business interests in the printing industry, Mercator and Ortelius should have met for the first time atthe Frankfurt Book Fair in 1554, and subsequently travelled together onbusiness throughout France in 1560.21 It is not clear how the more prosperous Mercator financed his trip, but it is significant that Ortelius, whowas ostensibly selling copies ofthe hand - painted maps in which he specialized, financed his trip by using his status as a geographical specialist toconduct commercial business on behalf of his friend Gilles Hooftman, one ofthe most successful merchants in late sixteenth - century Antwerp.22 Ortelius'subsequent career was characterized by his commerciallyastute ability to commission the engraving and printing of a series of regional maps of Europe for sale on the open market. Map - buyersincreasingly demanded that such maps be ever more detailed, reflectingthe growing complexity of the changing political geography of latesixteenth - century Europe. Engraved by skilled craftsmen and printed by Plantin, these maps went under Ortelius'name on the basis ofhis ability tocalculate a gap in the market and collate maps which were able to meet thespecific demands of an increasingly geographically literate community ofscholars, merchants and diplomats. Throughout the IS60s, as Mercatorworked on his world map, Ortelius began to develop a scheme to unitethe rapidly growing body of regional and global geographical knowledgeat his disposal into one volume, an atlas of contemporary geography. Whilst earlier printers and editors had redrawn Ptolemy's maps andprinted them in a single volume, they made little explicit attempt tomarket such a product as being of prime importance in interpreting anddefining the contemporary world of political geography. However, Ortelius was keen to stress that his new geographical product did just that; itwas to be an indispensable tool in understanding the social and politicalchanges which were transforming the society of late sixteenth - century Europe. His colleague Johannes Raedemaeker emphasized the politicaland commercial considerations which underpinned the production of thisnew geographical product: [Ortelius] also bought all the geographical maps that could be had for the sakenot only of calculating from the distances, the freight of merchandise and thedangers which they were exposed to, but to estimate the daily reports regardingthe European Wars. 23 Raedemaeker also explained that Ortelius'decision to construct a new atlasbased on these principles was primarily inspired by the commercial requirements of one of the geographer's most influential financial backers, Gilles Hooftman. Hooftman had complained to Ortelius that the use ofsingle - sheet maps for business had become a costly and cumbersome process, as large single - sheet maps were difficult to consult quickly and lackedgeographical standardization. What merchants like Hooftman requiredwas a compact, comprehensive, up - to - date collection of maps whichcould range from the regional to the global in providing specific information crucial to the rapid and effective movement ofgoods and merchandise. It was on these terms that, in May 1570, Ortelius finally published hismonumental atlas under the Latin title Theatrum Orbis Terrarum: 'A Theatre of the Terrestrial World'. In its scope and execution it was even moreambitious than Mercator's world map, which had been published the previous year. Along with an address to the reader written by Ortelius extollingthe virtues of his Theatrum, the volume contained a Catalogus Auctorumwhich provided a list ofthe eighty - seven cosmographers, geographers andcartographers associated with the project. This was followed by the Typus Orbis Terrarum (illus. 49), an updated world map, expunged of the moreglaring mistakes enshrined in Ptolemy's Geographia, which shared affinitiesin its geographical orientation with Mercator's map. There followed mapsof America, Asia, Africa and Europe, then fifty - six maps of the regions of Europe, six ofthose ofAsia and three regional maps ofAfrica. Containing atotal ofseventy maps on fifty - three leaves, the lavishly illustrated Theatrumalso contained detailed supplementary geographical accounts of theregions represented and their history. Ortelius'Theatrum was withoutdoubtthe most comprehensive and up - to - date geographicaltoemerge within the sixteenth century, a triumph of both the printing presswhich produced it and the scholarly community throughout Europe which, it was claimed, participated in its production. text Commercial success and scholarly praise for the Theatrum were immediate. The initial print run sold so well that a second edition wasprinted almost immediately. Copies sold for Fl. 6 lost., although with anastute eye for the market Ortelius also provided illuminated printed copieswhich sold for Fl. 16. To give some idea of the relative cost of the atlas, by QVID EI POTEST VIDERI MAGNVM IN OMNIS, TOTIVSQVE MV DI NO 49 Abraham Ortelius, 'Typus Orbis Terrarum', copperplate engraving from his Theatrum Orbis Terrarum, Antwerp, 1570. British Library, London. 1580 an unbound, unilluminated copy could be purchased for Fl. 12, thesame amount that a skilled printer involved in setting the Theatrum couldexpect to earn in a whole month.24 Rather than deterring buyers, the priceof this new geographical text and the time and skill invested in its printingclearly became one of its most attractive features. One satisfied customerwrote to Ortelius informing him that'the maps are very distinctly printed, and the paper is beautiful and white'.25 Yet it was Mercator's praise for theatlas, already briefly discussed in Chapter One, which was indicative oftheextent to which Ortelius had managed to unite intellectual innovation andcomprehensiveness with an astute eye to the commodification of the geographical image. In his letter to Ortelius written upon receipt of a copy ofthe Theatrum in 1570, Mercator praised him for having created a geographical artefact which was not only comprehensive but could be'kept in asmall place, and even carried about wherever we wish'. Mercator was convinced that'this work ofyours will always remain saleable, whatever mapsmay in the course of time be reprinted by others'.26 However, Mercator's praise was based on a mistaken assumption that, like his own world map, the Theatrum would stand as a static, historicallymonolithic representation of geographical knowledge. In fact, Ortelius'plans for the Theatrum were even more ambitious than Mercator had envisaged, and represented an entirely new approach to the production anddistribution of such knowledge. Ortelius had created a printed formatwhereby the skeleton structure of the Theatrum could remain in place, but increasingly incorporate a potentially endless variety of new mapsand information. By the end of 1570 another four editions had beenprinted, with minor changes. By 1571 a Dutch edition had appeared, andby 1573 a new Latin edition was printed, this time with new maps. By 1579 the Theatrum had expanded to include ninety - seven map sheets, incorporating maps of the classical world which firmly placed the classicalgeography of Ptolemy as supplemental to the contemporary geographicalimages produced by Ortelius and his network ofgeographers. Year by yearthe Theatrum grew in size and diversity until by 1612 there were no fewerthan forty - two editions in circulation, continually updated and expandedin Dutch, German, French, Spanish, English and Italian translations, aswell as the original Latin. The brilliance of Ortelius'Theatrum, as Mercator partly realized, lay in its ability to condense the diversity of bothclassical and contemporary geographical knowledge into a single volume, from which its owners could extract the information they required in aninstant, rather than consulting cumbersome wall maps which then had tobe cross - referenced to a mass of travel reports, geographical descriptionsand diplomatic documents. Another admiring owner of a copy of the Theatrum wrote to Ortelius in 1579 exclaiming: You compress the immense structure of land and sea into a narrow space, andhave made the earth portable, which a great many people assert to be immoveable. 27 Not only had Ortelius provided the consummate geographical artefactwhich insulated its readers from the deracinating effects purportedly suffered by the early Portuguese voyagers. He had also created the idealmedium through which to endlessly mediate the countless voyages, travels, encounters, exchanges and discoveries which the field of sixteenth - century geography attempted to record comprehensively. In his'Address to the Reader'he defined geography, and implicitly the functionof his Theatrum, as'The eye of History'.28 Yet in continuing this visualanalogy, Ortelius conceded the extent to which such a vision was an endlessly mediated process: This so necessary a knowledge of Geography, as many worthy and learned menhave testified, may very easily be learn'd out of Geographicall Chartes or Mappes. And when we have acquainted our selves somewhat with the use ofthese Tables or Mappes, or have attained thereby to some reasonable knowledgeof Geography, whatsoever we shall reade, these Chartes being placed, as it werecertaine glasses befOre our eyes, will the longer be kept in the memory, and make thedeeper impression in us: by which meanes it commeth to passe, that now we doseeme to perceive some fruit of that which we have read. 29 Ortelius'rhetoric aimed to ensure that the'glass'placed before the majority of the literate map - buying public of the late sixteenth century was the Theatrum, and that the endless representational mediations which madeup this eye on the world were only ultimately ratified by the authority ofthe maker of the glass: the geographer. Encompassing contemporarytopography, discovery and political administration as well as classical geography, Ortelius'Theatrum not only shaped the future direction ofgeographical representation, but it also undertook to define the historicalshape ofgeography as an intellectual discipline in its own right, thus finallyfreeing the field from the over - determined influence of Ptolemy and thepresuppositions of classical geography. The result was a further intensification of the professionalization of thegeographer and the commodification ofhis products. Ortelius emphasizedthe value of his Theatrum in the closing words of his'Address to the Reader', where he announced that: Wherefore the students of Geography shall have here, in the Authors thusnamed in order, and in the Catalogue of the Authors of the Geographicall Tables or Mappes, which we have set before this our worke, and lastly in these Tables themselves, a certain shoppe, as it were, furnished with all kinde of instruments necessarily required in such like businesse: out of which, ifperadventurethere may seeme anything wanting, in his judgement, either to the finishing ofany Booke of that argument, or more fuller descriptions ofany Countreys whatsoever, very easily, or in deed without any labour at all he may see, from whenceit may by and by be fetched. 30 In comparing the Theatrum to a shop, rather than stressing its value as aprecious intellectual commodity, Ortelius naturalized its presence as anindispensable part of the social and political life of the elites of latesixteenth - century Europe. In marketing it in this way, he ensured thathis atlas would not be perceived as a politically partial geographicalobject, in the way that Ribeiro's world map of 1529 had come to be associated with Charles V's claim to the Moluccas. Like Mercator, Orteliusmaximized not only the political neutrality of his work, but also its commercial success by stressing its utility to diplomats, merchants and scholarsof whatever political persuasion. In his'Address'he therefore stated hishope that'every student would affoord [the Theatrum] a place in his Library, amongst the rest of his bookes'.31 The Theatrum was to take itsplace in a textual universe of learning, expunged of the deleterious effectsof travel. Diplomats and statesmen could henceforth shape the territorialand commercial contours ofthe world, regardless ofthe effects which suchdecisions would have beyond the confines of their libraries. Whilst intellectually the Theatrum became a'library without walls'32 as it relentlesslyexpanded the parameters of geographical knowledge edition after edition, politically it allowed politicians to circumscribe the limits ofthe expandingworld and imaginatively carve it up in line with their own particular political preoccupations. The very fact that the Theatrum so loudly proclaimed its neutrality onlyenhanced its status as a politically significant object. Like Mercator, Ortelius attracted imperial patronage which enhanced the social esteemin which his work was held, and this led to attempts by its politicallypowerful patrons to put their own mark, very literally, on such an apparently objective geographical product. Yet even this overt politicalintervention into Ortelius'mapmaking was turned to the geographer'scommercial and financial benefit. In 1571 he forwarded a copy ofthe Theatrum for presentation to Charles V's son, the Spanish king Philip II. Thecopy was initially inspected by Cardinal Espinosa, chief minister to Philip, who searched in vain for his birthplace of Martimuiioz on themap of Spain printed in the Theatrum. Espinosa's aide, Hieronymus de Rhoda, swiftly wrote back to Ortelius informing him that: Cardinal [Espinosa] writes me from Spain that he regrets to find his native town Martimufioz, omitted in the map of Spain in your'Theatrum'and asks me tosend him a coloured copy of it with the said name inserted. Therefore remove, if possible, the name of Palacuelos and insert Martimufioz in its place. Whenthis is done let some copies of the map of Spain be printed to satisfy the Cardinal. And as a fleet will sail to Spain, with the first favourable wind, send byit two coloured copies ofthe'Theatrum'with the altered name; bound in leatherand gilt. Aries Montanus will pay the necessary expense.33 Subsequent editions of the Theatrum show the erasure of Palacuelos andthe insertion of Martimufioz (illus. So). Whilst there is no record of Ortelius'financial renumeration in undertaking this cartographical cooking of the books, it did have one particularly striking effect. Later on in thesame year Montanus was ordered to confer upon Ortelius the title of Geographer Royal of His Majesty Philip 11.34 This prestigious award (tosome extent a historical extension ofMercator's own geographical servicesto the House ofHabsburg) was clearly a reward for Ortelius'swift reprinting ofhis atlas to suit the tastes ofCardinal Espinosa, one ofPhilip's closestpolitical confidants. This remarkable incident exemplifies the extent to which Ortelius'Theatrum had become established as the most prized geographical possession ofthe sixteenth century. But perhaps even more significantly, it stresses theimportant shift in the power relations which increasingly characterizedthe production of later sixteenth - century geography. In the IS20S the Habsburg authorities had been able to dictate the terms ofgeographical representation, which had effectively portrayed a world picture that reflecteda range of commercial and territorial objectives in their own image. By the IS70S the same authorities were to be found petitioning increasingly powerful and authoritative geographers like Mercator and Ortelius for politicalconcessions in the way they depicted the world. The commercial considerations which had created the conditions for the cartography of the likes of Ribeiro and the Reinel brothers in the IS30S had ultimately given the geographer an unprecedented degree of intellectual and political autonomy, which he proceeded to exercise in the social and commercial disseminationof his printed maps and globes. Espinosa's intervention in the productionofthe Theatrum stressed that political partiality in the production ofsociallyinfluential maps and globes could be purchased: but at a price which was nolonger indexed to political loyalty but instead based its value on those ofthemarket - place. By IS88 the Plantin press responsible for printing Ortelius'Theatrum took full commercial advantage of the imperial patronage thework had attracted by issuing a luxurious copy of the first Spanish editionand dedicating it to Prince Asturias, the heir to the Spanish throne. Thisopulently illuminated and elaborately bound copy cost a staggering Fl. 90.35 In taking care to accede to the demands of figures such as Espinosa, Plantin and Ortelius ensured that, like Mercator, they reaped the maximum intellectualfrom tacitlyacknowledging the patronage of their Habsburg paymasters. availablefinancialrewardsand 50 Abraham Ortelius, map ofSpain, copperplate engraving from his Theatrum Orbis Terrarum, Antwerp, 1573. British Library, London. The End ofthe Line? The one thing that the dispute over the Moluccas had established onceand for all was the social and political value of geography, as both a logistical tool which facilitated the activities of merchants and diplomats and apolitically valuable resource in effectively laying claim to commerciallyprized territories overseas. However, in allowing geographers a degree ofintellectual freedom and creative autonomy to create a more comprehensive and standardized representation of the world, political patrons of thediscipline saw their authority to dictate the political contours of geographicalandrepresentation increasingly eroded. The commercialintellectual possibilities which the printing press created allowed geographers like Mercator and Ortelius to appreciate that their output would bemore commercially successful and intellectually respected if it distanceditself from the politically partial geography which had been producedaround the dispute over the Moluccas. By strategically drawing on theirimperial patronage, both geographers inexorably redefined the socialstatus ofearly modern geography as a discipline defined predominantly byits claims to intellectual objectivity and the demands of the market, ratherthan the demands ofan imperial crown or a politically influential patron. Itwas this shift which finally saw the emergence of a more recognizably'modern'discipline, which eschewed the principles ofpolitical speculationand the mysterious aura of the geographer which had defined late fifteenth - and sixteenth - century geography. Instead, the defining principlesof the discipline in the seventeenth century became objectivity and accuracy, as geography gradually transformed itselffrom a mysterious art into ascientifically exact field ofpolitical and commercial administration. This inno way saw the development ofa'true'science of geographical representation; the representational procedures which cartographydeveloped produced even more sophisticated techniques with which tooffer highly partial and ideological representations of the world.36 However, this shift towards claims to transparency and objectivity did signalthe death of early modem geography and the birth of a definably'modern'discipline, and it is with this shift that this particular study concludes. if anything, 6 Conclusion Throughout the course of this book I have argued for the importance ofwhat could be called the presence of the East in defining early modem European understanding of travel, commerce and geography. It was fromthis'eastern horizon'that sixteenth - century Europe increasingly came todefine its own social and geographical identity, as it gradually redefineditself in opposition to the old classical world depicted in Ptolemy's Geographia, and ultimately turned its back on this Old World to embrace anincreasingly predominant Atlantic World sketched out in Mercator's 1569 map. It therefore seems appropriate to conclude this study by oncemore invoking a map which signals the end of early modem geography, but at the same time retains traces of the continued presence of the Eastwithin the shaping of early European identity. Petrus Plancius'map of the Moluccas Islands, dated 1594 and entitled Insulae Moluccae (illus. 51), was symptomatic of the new social forceswhich increasingly came to define the field of seventeenth - century geography, whilst also implicitly looking backwards to the disputes of thefirst half of the sixteenth century which ultimately created this shift inthe field of geographical representation. Plancius'clinical depiction of thespice - producing islands which had caused so much controversy betweenthe crowns of Castile and Portugal is a vivid example of the changingpolitical and commercial landscape of the early modern world. Unlike Ribeiro's world map of 1529, or even Mercator's map of 1569, Plancius'map had not been produced under the auspices of imperial patronage. Instead its careful topographical and hydrographical information, andexact reproduction of commercially valuable commodities like nutmeg, cloves and sandalwood, were designed to aid the commercial initiatives ofthe new Compagnie van Verre, a Dutch company formed in Amsterdamin 1594. It was this company which was to form the basis of theseventeenth - century joint - stock company the Vereentgde Oost - Indische Compagnie, otherwise known as the Dutch East India Company. Themap therefore reflected one of the most significant political and commercial shifts to affect early modern Europe at the turn of the sixteenth 5 I Petrus Plancius, Insulae Moluccae, engraving, Antwerp, 1594 - British Library, London. century. This was the gradual erosion of the imperial authority of the Habsburg and Portuguese crowns in Southeast Asia, and their replacement by the aggressively mercantile power and authority of the Dutchand English East India companies. Privately funded and organized byfinanciers and merchants, these companies represented a distinct development in the commercial ethos which had characterized the activities of theempires of the Portuguese and the Habsburgs in Southeast Asia throughoutthan speculating on commercialventures to far - flung places, these new companies sought to incorporatethe entire trading network of the Indian and Pacific Oceans into one enormous monopoly. A string of commercial offices was established betweennorthern Europe and Southeast Asia to co - ordinate the flow of merchandise along the shipping lanes which connected these two points on themap of the world. the sixteenth century. Rather The consequences of this shift in political and commercial organizationwas substantial. Not only did it lead to an intensification and regulation ofthe range and size of commodities which moved back and forth between Europe and Asia, but it also led to the demand for ever more precise andobjective geographical products. Increasingly, the most up - to - date maps, charts and globes were produced not under the auspices of imperialcourts, but to the requirements of commercial companies such as the Dutch East India Company and its English rival, the East India Company. The most respected geographers working in the late sixteenth centuryowed their allegiance not to their crowns, but to the joint - stock companieswhich based themselves in the metropolitan centres of early modern Europe. Upon the formation of the English East India Company in 1601, the English geographer and travel writer Richard Hakluyt was employedto provide maps of the East Indies to facilitate its commercial activities. The minutes of the company's meeting of 29 January 1601 recorded that: Mr. Hacklett, the historiographer of the voyages of the East Indies, being herebefore the Committees and having read unto them out of his notes and booksdivers instructions for provisions ofJewels, was required to set down in writinga note of the principal places in the East Indies where Trade is to be had, to theend the same may be used for the better instruction of our factors in the saidvoyage. I Less than a month later the records of the company noted that: There is given to Mr. Hackett [sic] by the assent of this assembly for his travailstaken in instructions and advices touching the preparing of the voyage and forhis former advices in setting the voyages in hand the last year the sum of tenpounds, and thirty shillings for three maps by him provided and debited to thecompany.2 Like Plancius, Hakluyt became an informal employee of a joint - stockcompany that was concerned not with partial geography which inflatedits territorial claims to far - flung territories, but with accurate geographicaldescriptions of the sea routes and topography of the areas it specified ascrucial in expanding their commercial presence. By the 1620S the Dutch East India Company had created a hydrographic office in Amsterdamwhich sought to co - ordinate the systematic mapping of the territoriesacross which the company established its theatre of commercial operations.3 So sophisticated had this mapping process become that the officesin Amsterdam quickly established one in Batavia, to create new maps andcharts of the Indonesian region which were forwarded to Amsterdam forincorporation into the charts and globes produced for the exclusive use ofthe pilots and administrators of the company. The effect which this new process of mapping had upon the field ofgeography was gradual but profound. In attempting to systematicallymap every inch ofdistant territory through local surveys, the geographicaland hydrographical practices of the new commercial companies spelt theend of the speculative geography of the early sixteenth century whoseprinciples have formed the basis of this particular study. The maps andglobes of earlier geographers like Behaim and Ribeiro had deliberatelyexploited the partial and often conflictual accounts of distant territories tocreate politically and commercially compelling'imaginative geographies'which convinced backers with a mixture of aesthetic beauty and loudlyproclaimed scholarly wisdom. The practical difficulties of physicallyreaching remote places allowed the geographer to utilize his conjecturalknowledge of geographically distant phenomena to invest both his products and his social status with an aura of prestige and awe at his abilityto represent, almost magically, such distant and inaccessible places. The processes of mapping that developed throughout the early seventeenth century gradually eroded this perception of the geographer and hisproducts. The joint - stock companies were not interested in speculating oncommercially valuable and geographically distant territories, or in commissioning studies which inflated their own commercial and politicalimportance. What mattered to them was the accurate, objective andsystematic mapping ofstrategic territory. As a result, geographical specialists like Plancius and Hakluyt, initially self - styled savants on the lines of Behaim and Ribeiro, were absorbed into the institutional structures of or India companies, which provided ampleganizations like the Eastopportunities for them to exercise their wisdom in exchange for a specificposition and salary. The new model ofgeographical production was exemplified in the monumental globes and atlases produced in Hollandthroughout the seventeenth century, which have been most famouslydepicted in the paintings of Jan Vermeer. The Atlas Maior of the great Dutch geographer Joan Blaeu, published in 1662, was symptomatic ofthis changing perception of geography (illus. 52). Blaeu's was the first geographical atlas to finally surpass Ortelius'Theatrum in its scale andcomprehensiveness. Comprising twelve volumes with 3,000 pages of textand approximately 600 maps, the Atlas was a massive intellectual andcommercial undertaking. Indirectly its production had been financed bythe Dutch East India Company, who had appointed Blaeu as its officialmapmaker in 1638.4 Blaeu therefore exemplified the new model of thegeographical specialist, which had been anticipated by Ortelius in hisown skilful marketing of his Theatrum. Employed by the company andutilizing its growing body of carefully collated charts and geographicalinformation, Blaeu represented a new type of geographer who eschewedspeculation in the pursuit of the construction ofa globally comprehensivegeography. Blaeu's career in relation to the Dutch East India Company was in starkcontrast to the careers of the earlier geographers who have been examinedthroughout the course ofthis book. Organizations like the Dutch and English East India companies were too large and impersonal to accommodatethe entrepreneurial activities of a geographical figure like Behaim who, inthe absence of an organized commercial company at the end of thefifteenth century, acted as not only a geographer but also a traveller, merchant, mathematician and globemaker. The companies gradually separated out all these jobs into specific offices and administrative duties, thus denying the geographer the opportunity to move across a range ofdisciplines which had previously made maps and globes so compelling intheir ability to permeate so many corners of early modern life. The incorporation within the companies of the most up - to - date geographicalmaterial marked the decline ofthe map as a skilfully marketed and covetedmaterial object, capable of crossing political and cultural boundaries. The 52 Joan Blaeu, world map, engraving from his Atlas Maior, Amsterdam, 1662. British Library, London. irony was that, in its emergence along the trade routes via the Cape of Good Hope and deep into Southeast Asia throughout the late fifteenthand sixteenth centuries, the discipline of geography had assisted in thesuccessful establishment ofa commercial network which, by the beginningof the seventeenth century, saw the geographer reduced to the role ofskilled administrator, whilst his maps increasingly functioned as hydrographical and topographical tools, useful commodities with which toapproach the business of trade and ultimately, as the seventeenth centuryprogressed, colonization. Late fifteenth - and sixteenth - century geography had only ever reallybeen based on the ability to speculate and conjecture on the imaginativepossession of distant territories. The insurmountable difficulties of actually implementing the claims to global authority and possession made bythe maps and globes of geographers like Ribeiro and Frisius did not, however, make them any less effective and valuable in the eyes ofthe merchantsand diplomats who used them. Precisely because of the impossibility ofseriously laying claim to global possession, the map and the globe becamethe most powerful instruments through which to construct a rhetoric ofclaims to commercial and political power and authority, as Charles V showed in the dispute over the Moluccas. They were intensely valuablemediators in the construction of the social life of the early modernperiod. Their commercial and political value only changed at the point atwhich the field of geography assimilated itself within the administrativeand scientific structures of seventeenth - century European society. Thisassimilation increasingly divested the map of its power to mediate thedistant and mysterious limits of the early modem world. Rather thanbeing a source of wonder and mystery, the geographical object, be it mapor globe, increasingly laid claim to its presence as a studiedly transparentimage of an increasingly known world. At this moment early moderngeography lost its fascinating ability to entwine commerce, finance, traveland diplomacy in its dense and often fragmented images of the world. Itwas at this point that a certain ethos which defined the mapping of theearly modern world came to an end. References Introduction I B. Diffie and G.

Whilst it is unclear as to whether or not Magellan actually consulted Behaim's terrestrial globe, as reference is made here to a'chart', there seems little doubt that whatever maps and charts (which have notsurvived) Behaim constructed were based on similar geographical information tothat applied in the construction of his globe. Magellan was therefore inheriting aview of the world which must have looked very much like the shape of the terrestrialsphere represented by the Behaim globe. 9 Marcel Destombes, 'The chart ofMagellan', Imago Mundi, 12 (1955), pp. 65 - 79 10 Bartholomew Leonardo de Argensola, The Discovery and Conquest ofthe Molucco Islands (London, 1708), p.

      "📖 **Document Type**: Book (Brotton's \"Trading Territories\")\n",
      "📏 **Size**: 464,644 characters, 8,647 lines\n",
      "\n",
      "🔧 **Original Function Performance**:\n",
      "• ❌ Too aggressive - removed ALL line breaks\n",
      "• ❌ Merged entire book into single paragraph\n",
      "• ❌ 1.28% reduction but destroyed structure\n",
      "\n",
      "✅ **Book-Optimized Function Performance**:\n",
      "• ✅ Preserved paragraph structure (90% of lines kept)\n",
      "• ✅ Cleaned encoding artifacts and metadata\n",
      "• ✅ 0.6% reduction while maintaining readability\n",
      "• ✅ Fixed hyphenated word breaks only\n",
      "• ✅ Preserved chapter/section boundaries\n",
      "\n",
      "🎯 **Key Insights**:\n",
      "1. Books need different cleaning than academic papers\n",
      "2. Line breaks are meaningful in books (paragraphs, chapters)\n",
      "3. Academic papers have more OCR artifacts to remove\n",
      "4. Word break fixing must be much more conservative for books\n",
      "\n",
      "📋 **Recommendations**:\n",
      "• Use book-optimized version for narrative texts\n",
      "• Use original version for academic papers with heavy OCR artifacts\n",
      "• Consider document type when choosing cleaning aggressiveness\n",
      "• Books generally have cleaner OCR and need gentler processing\n",

    "🎯 **Key Insights**:\n",
    "1. Books need different cleaning than academic papers\n",

    "📋 **Recommendations**:\n",
    "• Use book-optimized version for narrative texts\n",
    "• Use original version for academic papers with heavy OCR artifacts\n",
    "• Consider document type when choosing cleaning aggressiveness\n",
    "• Books generally have cleaner OCR and need gentler processing\n",

    "The updated `clean_ocr_text_advanced()` function now handles these additional OCR problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🆕 New Features Added:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Character Recognition Errors:**\n",
    "- Scattered letters (e.g., \"T h e\" → \"The\")\n",
    "- Spaced numbers (e.g., \"1 9 9 8\" → \"1998\") \n",
    "- Common letter confusions (rn→m, cl→c l, fi→f i)\n",
    "- Number/letter mix-ups (0→O, 1→I, 5→S in context)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Word Breaking Issues:**\n",
    "- Hyphenated words across lines (e.g., \"hyph-\\nated\" → \"hyphenated\")\n",
    "- Words broken without hyphens (e.g., \"cross\\nlines\" → \"crosslines\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**Punctuation & Spacing:**\n",
    "- Fix spaced punctuation (e.g., \"word , word\" → \"word, word\")\n",
    "- Normalize quote spacing\n",
    "- Fix apostrophe spacing\n",
    "- Proper dash spacing (em-dash, en-dash)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Enhanced Metadata Removal:**\n",
    "- ISBN/ISSN removal\n",
    "- Copyright notices\n",
    "- Publisher information  \n",
    "- More timestamp patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Character Encoding:**\n",
    "- Zero-width invisible characters\n",
    "- Form feed and control characters\n",
    "- Better Unicode artifact handling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Text Structure:**\n",
    "- Remove lines of just numbers (page references)\n",
    "- Better filtering of meaningless lines\n",
    "- Improved citation formatting\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 Performance on Your Document:\n",
    "- **12.2% size reduction** (vs 11.7% before)\n",
    "- Better preservation of meaningful content\n",
    "- Cleaner text for RAG processing\n",
    "\n",
    "The function is now much more robust for handling real-world OCR problems from scanned academic papers, books, and historical documents!"

    "\n",
    "**✅ This script works well for:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Academic papers from JSTOR, ProQuest, etc.** - Handles common metadata artifacts\n",
    "2. **Scanned books/documents** - Removes OCR encoding issues\n",
    "3. **Legal documents** - Cleans court filing artifacts and headers  \n",
    "4. **Historical texts** - Handles archival scanning artifacts\n",
    "5. **News articles** - Removes web scraping artifacts\n",
    "6. **Government documents** - Cleans formatting from PDF conversions\n",
    "\n",
    "**⚠️ May need customization for:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Technical papers with equations** - Math symbols might get removed\n",
    "2. **Multi-column layouts** - May scramble reading order\n",
    "3. **Tables and charts** - Structure could be lost\n",
    "4. **Non-English texts** - Character filtering might be too aggressive\n",
    "5. **Ancient/medieval texts** - Special characters might be important\n",
    "\n",
    "**🔧 Customization tips:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **For math-heavy texts**: Set `remove_cid=False` to preserve symbols\n",
    "- **For foreign languages**: Adjust the non-ASCII regex pattern\n",
    "- **For structured data**: Reduce `min_line_length` to preserve short entries\n",
    "- **For modern web content**: Add more URL/social media patterns\n",
    "- **For old texts**: Add patterns for archival stamps and catalog numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "**📊 RAG System Benefits:**\n",
    "- **Better chunking**: Clean text splits more logically\n",
    "- **Improved retrieval**: Less noise in vector embeddings  \n",
    "- **Cleaner context**: LLM sees relevant content, not metadata\n",
    "- **Faster processing**: Smaller text size reduces token usage"

    "\n",
    "### 🏆 **Excellent Performance on Historical Text**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `clean_ocr_text_smart` function performed exceptionally well on the much larger and older Brantome PDF:\n",
    "\n",
    "**📊 Key Metrics:**\n",
    "- **Size**: 1.19M characters (largest test document)\n",
    "- **Age**: Historical text (likely more challenging OCR)\n",
    "- **Detection**: Correctly identified as BOOK\n",
    "- **Cleaning**: Gentle 0.8% reduction (perfect for preserving historical content)\n",
    "- **Line Preservation**: 77% of lines kept (appropriate for older formatting)\n",
    "\n",
    "**🎯 Why This Performance is Ideal:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Appropriate Detection**: Recognized as book despite no modern publishing metadata\n",
    "2. **Gentle Processing**: Minimal content loss while removing artifacts  \n",
    "3. **Structure Preservation**: Maintained historical formatting and paragraph breaks\n",
    "4. **Smart Adaptation**: Applied book-specific cleaning rules automatically\n",
    "\n",
    "**📈 Comparison Across All Documents:**\n",
    "- **Academic Paper**: 13.2% reduction (aggressive, needed)\n",
    "- **Modern Book**: 0.5% reduction (gentle, appropriate) \n",
    "- **Historical Text**: 0.8% reduction (minimal, perfect)\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ **Ready for Zotero Integration**\n",
    "\n",
    "The smart function successfully handles:\n",
    "- ✅ Modern academic papers with heavy OCR artifacts\n",
    "- ✅ Contemporary books with clean formatting  \n",
    "- ✅ Historical texts requiring careful preservation\n",
    "- ✅ Automatic type detection and appropriate processing\n",
